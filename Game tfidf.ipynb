Balance is in a much better state as well as the game. The game is taking longer to reach where it needs to be now with a smaller team, but it is a team that cares. This game received too much hate on launch because people compared to an almost 20 year old coh1, and a 10+ year old COH2. But base game to base game COH3 had so much more content than either game on launch. And its bolstered on to it.\n\nWith new commanders coming it should breath new life into the game. Relic has been doing a great job to the improvement of the game. It is personally my favorite RTS to date. I highly suggest you try this game, and do it with an open mind as its style does differ from traditional coh titles. But once you grasp it, it just becomes that much more fun then it ever was before.\n\nThe only thing COH3 is lacking is commander diversity which will come in time, and once we hit that level of content, COH1 and 2 will become completely irrelevant. So give it a try, do so with an open mind, and lets keep our beloved franchise alive!",

COH3 has a lot of potential despite its immature release, it took a long time to get at where it is now but honestly props to the Dev's and staff of Relic as they had to earn there respect as an effective fun RTS Game Company. I have a lot of respect for relic and there hard work keep it up please. In the future I hope they start adding more utility to units and as well as more light medium vehicle option for example a Bren Carrier would be really cool for British.

I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.\n\nIf you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money.

They also gave \n free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. \n\nAll in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.

Loading screen name/team bug: [/b] So far I haven't seen this bug again. So perhaps it has been fixed\n\n[b]2. Early and Mid game balance issue: [/b] with the new 2.0 update, the meta certainly changes. I haven't played much to know for sure which spam got buffed and which got nerfed. So far I only found new USF half-track spam since they got cheaper (or maybe I have been playing on low ELO for too much I rarely find this spam)\n\n[b]3. Replay watch sync-error issue: [/b] Issue addressed I think? Haven't found any replay errors yet.\n\n[b]4. Auto-match balance issue: [/b] I might be biased but I think it's been fixed as well. Tho someone certainly need to make tutorial to teach the Axis newbies how to deal with early Allies light tank/armored car rush coz I see them getting their ass handed immediately once it happens.\n\n[b]5. Can't buy the 4th battlegroup of wehrmacht and USF factions in-game with merits without the corresponding DLC: [/b] The in-game UI has been fixed. It now tells you to buy the DLC to buy the battlegroup. Just like the new fire & steel battlegroups.\n\n[b]6. Rapido River Crossing bugs: [/b] I still haven't tried this map again. It used to have a lot of bugs that can happen in this map so I always have it downvoted. examples are: breach cannot finish so unit gets stuck doing nothing, AT gun crews out of action but the AT gun itself still capable of moving around and attack with 0 HP.

Very fun game that has moved the series forward in a way that makes the older games very difficult to go back and play. At this point, the game is well worth the money at full price. Sure, occasionally balance is out of whack and can be frustrating... but that is what you get with an RTS that is still putting out new content/units. Overall the game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend for all those interested in skirmish/multiplayer \r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: I completed both campaigns at launch and thought Italian was \"solid\" but way too repetitive, while the African campaign was \"meh\" because it was bare bones and pretty short.

I am loving all of it, graphics, gameplay, sounds, depth and all the options available to customize your playstyle.\r\n\r\nCOH 3 is top 5 RTS ever played in 30+ years of gaming. The total-war style game mode is excellent, scenarios and diversity of missions is great too, especially for a first try in that genre. (and I am a huge total war fan/player). Skirmishes are very good as well. I don't play multi, but found enough content for solo players to estimate a 50 to 100 hours play-through before moving to another game. \r\n\r\nWell done to the full Relic team for fixing and updating things.
