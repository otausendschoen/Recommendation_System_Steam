These are all the currently main issues that affect me as a PVE only player.\n\n1. AI sucks, they're really easy to predict and usually only have a single build order. For example, they have a fixed rule of \"if vehicle is less than 20% hp, retreat to base regardless of situation\" and since the AI can see through FOW, units sometimes cower in cover before you see them, tanks run to the edges of the map.\n2. Modding has been severely limited in this game intentionally, leading to some mod devs to even choose to stay with CoH2.\n3. Worse atmosphere and audio, the lighting just seems off, voicelines are not memorable and some are recycled between units. We had faction specific main menu music, battle and victory themes in CoH2, it's the same every faction every game in CoH3.\n4. The new dlc, they are charging us half the price of the base game. Personally, even if this was a F2P game, locking more than half of the heavy tanks behind a dlc feels scummy. (DLC contains Pershing, Elefant, King Tiger and Churchill Crocodile. Base contains Churchill, it's variant Black Prince and Tiger.)\n5. The new CoH3 merit system. Complete challenges and supposedly earn battlegroups (the DLCs) and skins with the in game merit currency system. This was changed recently, battlegroups are now not earnable, the skin shop is just sad with very limited choices. Hundreds of hours spent on the merit challenges just to have the main reward silently taken away, mentioned only in one update post.\n\nMost of my time spent in CoH3 was earning merit challenges in boring games whereas in CoH2 I played for fun. At least for VS Ai players, I highly recommend staying with/getting CoH2 with mods. I cannot recommend enough All Units (170 added) mod by SneakEye and avoiding CoH3 for now.",

Balance is in a much better state as well as the game. The game is taking longer to reach where it needs to be now with a smaller team, but it is a team that cares. This game received too much hate on launch because people compared to an almost 20 year old coh1, and a 10+ year old COH2. But base game to base game COH3 had so much more content than either game on launch. And its bolstered on to it.\n\nWith new commanders coming it should breath new life into the game. Relic has been doing a great job to the improvement of the game. It is personally my favorite RTS to date. I highly suggest you try this game, and do it with an open mind as its style does differ from traditional coh titles. But once you grasp it, it just becomes that much more fun then it ever was before.\n\nThe only thing COH3 is lacking is commander diversity which will come in time, and once we hit that level of content, COH1 and 2 will become completely irrelevant. So give it a try, do so with an open mind, and lets keep our beloved franchise alive!",

Is it because the game isn't finished enough? \nWell kinda, but that's not my biggest issue with it.\n\n\nThe biggest issue is the cost. It's a very expensive game for what you get for it, and additionally, most of the content being added isn't included in the base game, but rather is half as expensive as the already-too-expensive game itself. Then to consider the fact that if you want a single 'battlegroup' as it were, you have to pay for other ones you may have zero interest in playing with, or trying. You HAVE TO pay for those other ones, to access the one you may want. \n\nBut what about the gameplay?\n\nIt's actually fun, in pvp. Unlike in CoH2 where players would always try to rush tanks and they would be nearly unstoppable, it's worth considering that the tanks are actually a lot more receptive to damage, especially from flanking, which makes positioning way more important than in previous titles (although it was important then as well). There are handy new QoL improvements, although your muscle memory of pressing T to retreat will get your squads killed because that standard button is now R. I'm not saying you CAN'T rush tanks and be unstoppable, but when you're getting your first tanks out, you have to be more careful with them, because infantry can do some serious damage, given the right equipment. \n\nI will say though, the Axis powers feel somewhat weak compared to their predecessors. I mean, where's the panzershreks? (Locked behind a paywall!)\n\nNow, onto the state of the game: \n\nIt's fun, but again, it feels unfinished. This is especially disappointing because the game has now been out for 2 years. Instead of more content for players who paid for the overly expensive game, there's content being monetized at half the cost of the base game itself. Formerly free content is also poised to become 'not free' and cost roughly half of that cost before the end of the month, if you didn't claim it before then. \n\nI understand the need to continue to have cash flow in the business, but overcharging for everything isn't going to do you any favors with your consumers, because there's other games (including your own former title) that, in spite of its own flaws, has a... better monetization scheme. Instead of $30 battlegroups that contain several that you may never touch, consider CoH2, where commanders would cost something like $3-4, and there were already plenty of them that were accessible to players who only owned the base game (not including the problematic nature of only having 2 of the factions available to play for free). \n\nLower the costs. Friends of mine tried the free weekend and refuse to pay the extreme cost of the game, even at a 50% discount due to how predatory the cost is, for what included content is available.",

I finished the DAK campaign and it was a total bore, with not a lot of interesting things or scenarios to play out.

The balance is also extremely wonky - some maps are pushovers, some are deathmarches that have you lose even if you micro well as the AI seems like it never loses resources nor men to throw at you.\n\nExtremely disappointing - unless you really wanna play multiplayer, dont buy this game.

Since the start of 2025, the number of exploits and cheats like fov expansion and fog of war removal has grown staggeringly. I come across this in every 2-3 matches and it's just a nuisance to play against. Artillery/Mortar on hidden units, nullifies your flanks, and then exploits your openings.\nRelic do have reporting system and claim to take action since the release of the fire & steel, but it's not the case, in fact, there is more cheats now than ever.  It is just not fun to play against. \n\nI don't like to throw accusations of cheats out there, but relics replay system and pov of the suspect makes it very easy to verify this, some don't even try to hid it in the first place... There have been numerous reddit posts about this and it's just so easy to cheat in this game it's wild. I will say cheats is THE biggest problem/hindrance for coh3 multiplayer \n\n[*]The unit exploits. It is no surprise to bring up blobbing in this franchise... but it is just sad in coh3. What's the point of diversifying units when you can just build 8 main line infantry, mgs, or any other of the same unit and throw them out all at once? I see it mainly with USF and riflemen (or rangers), Brits and crusaders, Werhm and mgs, Dakand Bersa. In low and high elo games there is no sense of strategy, just keep throwing a large volume of the same unit and you will have success.\n\nAt least in coh2 there were better counters to this, but Relic just can not find a way to balance this in coh3 despite them acknowledging the issue but making no real effort to solve it... It is a boring play style to play as or against in this game.\n[/olist]\n\nIn the end, I've always liked Relic as a studio, I do understand their constraints now being an independent studio and they do try to improve the game... but in the wrong way. Audio, graphics, new units etc have all been massively improved and gives a fresh breath, but the 2 foundational problems just ruins the experience and damages Relics efforts to get more people to contiinously play and support the game.",

There are too few players as well, you will spend a long time looking for players and most of them aren't very good too, as a COH2 veteran the COH2 has a lot more stuff, take the camos for instance in COH3 they are totally random and there are some kind camos that only apply to one unit! It's not like COH2 where they can applied to all vehicles, which in a COH looks weird in a development point of view like:\"So the Fallen Leaf camo only applies to 3 tanks and like 2 infantry units?\"; \"So I can't apply camos to the Tiger or Panther or King Tiger in the Wehrmacht but I can apply for the Tiger in the Afrika Corps but not for thr Ferdinand?\".

And the AI still has that nasty habit of VIEWING THE ENTIRE MAP ALL THE TIME, which is game breaking at times:\"Oh look I am assembling all my forces here far from the line of sight of the enemy... is that a airstrike and an artillary strike in the middle of the formation?!\". In my opinion they should start fixing the Cosmetics and do them like in COH2, that system was a Work Of Art!! Instead of launching an expansion and keeping the same problems. Now they came a long way for the Zero Day COH3 which was a copy and paste of COH2, unstable, cartoony and goofy at times. There are things that are really cool like: the sound effects, some of the visual effects, death animnations, vehicle wreckages, but still it leaves much to be desired in the UI and AI. Just fix the Cosmetics by making camos available for every unit including the Call Ability ones; Fix the AI omniscience; And another thing that really bothers me like hell is when the vehicles treads do not match their speed and it looks like they are floating or sliding like on the King Tiger. I just bought the game and every content to help them out, maybe they really want to fix it.",

So I waited until last year when it was 50 percent off, and since then I can't complain at all. I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.\n\nIf you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money. With my current hours and current invest into the game averages out to 0.75 cents and hour. How much value are people really going to cry about? They also gave \n free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. \n\nAll in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.  We can't except them to constantly work for free. \n\nThere are so many games that are released, review bombed and subsequently dropped and abandoned. OR we complain that releases aren't pushed fast enough, or updates and DLC aren't made quick enough, well we can't have our cake and eat it too.

      "\n",
      "✨ The Cake May Be a Lie, But the Brilliance is Real!\n",
      "Portal 2 isn’t just a game—it’s an intellectual playground that challenges your mind, tickles your funny bone, and immerses you in a world where physics, storytelling, and humor collide in perfect harmony. Valve took the innovative mechanics of the original Portal and expanded them into a fully fleshed-out masterpiece that still stands as one of the greatest games ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧩 Gameplay – A Brain-Bending Work of Art\n",
      "At its core, Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle-platformer where you use the iconic Portal Gun to place two linked portals on surfaces, allowing for mind-bending traversal and puzzle-solving. But Valve went beyond simple portals:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ New Mechanics – Exciting additions like Gels (speed, bounce, and portal-friendly surfaces), Light Bridges, Excursion Funnels, and Aerial Faith Plates elevate the puzzles to a whole new level.\n",
      "✅ Perfectly Paced Difficulty – The game introduces new mechanics gradually, ensuring you feel like a genius with every challenge you overcome.\n",
      "✅ Co-op Mode – The two-player cooperative campaign is an entirely separate story where teamwork is essential, leading to some of the best cooperative puzzle-solving in gaming history.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 Story & Characters – Witty, Dark, and Unforgettable\n",
      "Valve infused Portal 2 with one of the most brilliant narratives in gaming, blending dark humor, mystery, and sci-fi intrigue into a seamless experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎙️ GLaDOS (Ellen McLain) – The return of gaming’s most iconic AI villain is pure gold. Her sarcastic, passive-aggressive humor is sharper than ever, making her both a terrifying and hilarious presence.\n",
      "💡 Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) – The bumbling, dim-witted AI core brings comedic genius to the game, leading to some of the funniest dialogue ever written.\n",
      "🏢 Aperture Science’s History – The deeper dive into the Aperture Science facility and the tragic (yet hilarious) history of Cave Johnson (J.K. Simmons) adds layers of intrigue and absurdity to the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t just a puzzle game—it’s an intelligent, character-driven story with twists, turns, and unforgettable moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎶 Soundtrack & Atmosphere – Immersion at Its Finest\n",
      "🎵 Mike Morasky’s soundtrack is both eerie and mesmerizing, dynamically adjusting to your actions. And let’s not forget the legendary ending song, “Want You Gone,” which is just as iconic as Still Alive from the first game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The level design is stunning, transitioning from pristine test chambers to the rusty, forgotten depths of Aperture Science, making every environment feel unique and alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "🏆 Verdict – A Perfect 10/10 Experience\n",
      "✅ Mind-blowing puzzles that never feel repetitive.\n",

         "I still believe CoH2 is the superior choice currently, if you haven't tried/gotten used to the new QoLs in this game. These are all the currently main issues that affect me as a PVE only player.\n\n1. AI sucks, they're really easy to predict and usually only have a single build order. For example, they have a fixed rule of \"if vehicle is less than 20% hp, retreat to base regardless of situation\" and since the AI can see through FOW, units sometimes cower in cover before you see them, tanks run to the edges of the map.\n2. Modding has been severely limited in this game intentionally, leading to some mod devs to even choose to stay with CoH2.\n3. Worse atmosphere and audio, the lighting just seems off, voicelines are not memorable and some are recycled between units. We had faction specific main menu music, battle and victory themes in CoH2, it's the same every faction every game in CoH3.\n4. The new dlc, they are charging us half the price of the base game. Personally, even if this was a F2P game, locking more than half of the heavy tanks behind a dlc feels scummy. (DLC contains Pershing, Elefant, King Tiger and Churchill Crocodile. Base contains Churchill, it's variant Black Prince and Tiger.)\n5. The new CoH3 merit system. Complete challenges and supposedly earn battlegroups (the DLCs) and skins with the in game merit currency system. This was changed recently, battlegroups are now not earnable, the skin shop is just sad with very limited choices. Hundreds of hours spent on the merit challenges just to have the main reward silently taken away, mentioned only in one update post.\n\nMost of my time spent in CoH3 was earning merit challenges in boring games whereas in CoH2 I played for fun. At least for VS Ai players, I highly recommend staying with/getting CoH2 with mods. I cannot recommend enough All Units (170 added) mod by SneakEye and avoiding CoH3 for now.",

Balance is in a much better state as well as the game. The game is taking longer to reach where it needs to be now with a smaller team, but it is a team that cares. This game received too much hate on launch because people compared to an almost 20 year old coh1, and a 10+ year old COH2. But base game to base game COH3 had so much more content than either game on launch. And its bolstered on to it.\n\nWith new commanders coming it should breath new life into the game. Relic has been doing a great job to the improvement of the game. It is personally my favorite RTS to date. I highly suggest you try this game, and do it with an open mind as its style does differ from traditional coh titles. But once you grasp it, it just becomes that much more fun then it ever was before.\n\nThe only thing COH3 is lacking is commander diversity which will come in time, and once we hit that level of content, COH1 and 2 will become completely irrelevant. So give it a try, do so with an open mind, and lets keep our beloved franchise alive!",

Is it because the game isn't finished enough? \nWell kinda, but that's not my biggest issue with it.\n\n\nThe biggest issue is the cost. It's a very expensive game for what you get for it, and additionally, most of the content being added isn't included in the base game, but rather is half as expensive as the already-too-expensive game itself. Then to consider the fact that if you want a single 'battlegroup' as it were, you have to pay for other ones you may have zero interest in playing with, or trying. You HAVE TO pay for those other ones, to access the one you may want. \n\nBut what about the gameplay?\n\nIt's actually fun, in pvp. Unlike in CoH2 where players would always try to rush tanks and they would be nearly unstoppable, it's worth considering that the tanks are actually a lot more receptive to damage, especially from flanking, which makes positioning way more important than in previous titles (although it was important then as well). There are handy new QoL improvements, although your muscle memory of pressing T to retreat will get your squads killed because that standard button is now R. I'm not saying you CAN'T rush tanks and be unstoppable, but when you're getting your first tanks out, you have to be more careful with them, because infantry can do some serious damage, given the right equipment. \n\nI will say though, the Axis powers feel somewhat weak compared to their predecessors. I mean, where's the panzershreks? (Locked behind a paywall!)\n\nNow, onto the state of the game: \n\nIt's fun, but again, it feels unfinished. This is especially disappointing because the game has now been out for 2 years. Instead of more content for players who paid for the overly expensive game, there's content being monetized at half the cost of the base game itself. Formerly free content is also poised to become 'not free' and cost roughly half of that cost before the end of the month, if you didn't claim it before then. \n\nI understand the need to continue to have cash flow in the business, but overcharging for everything isn't going to do you any favors with your consumers, because there's other games (including your own former title) that, in spite of its own flaws, has a... better monetization scheme. Instead of $30 battlegroups that contain several that you may never touch, consider CoH2, where commanders would cost something like $3-4, and there were already plenty of them that were accessible to players who only owned the base game (not including the problematic nature of only having 2 of the factions available to play for free). \n\nLower the costs. Friends of mine tried the free weekend and refuse to pay the extreme cost of the game, even at a 50% discount due to how predatory the cost is, for what included content is available.",

COH was one of my favorite franchises and I figured that there had been sufficient time since launch for the bugs of the game to get ironed out. Also, I really enjoy playing the campaign of the game, even if the story can be uneven at times. So, I was looking forward to spending some time on this game...\n\n...I wish I had returned it.\n\nThe campaign is dull, uninspired and a bug-filled mess. I finished the DAK campaign and it was a total bore, with not a lot of interesting things or scenarios to play out. The story was abysmal and the characters feel like caricature of historical figures/peoples. \n\nThe Italian Campaign was worse story-wise, but at least I thought that the skirmish-type gameplay and random scenarios were at least somewhat less monotonous. I was even starting to enjoy the game slightly - but then I ran into a bug where a city would continuously get attacked and defended, but even if I win the battle the city would remain in enemy hands. The balance is also extremely wonky - some maps are pushovers, some are deathmarches that have you lose even if you micro well as the AI seems like it never loses resources nor men to throw at you.\n\nExtremely disappointing - unless you really wanna play multiplayer, dont buy this game.

Since the start of 2025, the number of exploits and cheats like fov expansion and fog of war removal has grown staggeringly. I come across this in every 2-3 matches and it's just a nuisance to play against. Artillery/Mortar on hidden units, nullifies your flanks, and then exploits your openings.\nRelic do have reporting system and claim to take action since the release of the fire & steel, but it's not the case, in fact, there is more cheats now than ever.  It is just not fun to play against. \n\nI don't like to throw accusations of cheats out there, but relics replay system and pov of the suspect makes it very easy to verify this, some don't even try to hid it in the first place... There have been numerous reddit posts about this and it's just so easy to cheat in this game it's wild. I will say cheats is THE biggest problem/hindrance for coh3 multiplayer \n\n[*]The unit exploits. It is no surprise to bring up blobbing in this franchise... but it is just sad in coh3. What's the point of diversifying units when you can just build 8 main line infantry, mgs, or any other of the same unit and throw them out all at once? I see it mainly with USF and riflemen (or rangers), Brits and crusaders, Werhm and mgs, Dakand Bersa. In low and high elo games there is no sense of strategy, just keep throwing a large volume of the same unit and you will have success.\n\nAt least in coh2 there were better counters to this, but Relic just can not find a way to balance this in coh3 despite them acknowledging the issue but making no real effort to solve it... It is a boring play style to play as or against in this game.\n[/olist]\n\nIn the end, I've always liked Relic as a studio, I do understand their constraints now being an independent studio and they do try to improve the game... but in the wrong way. Audio, graphics, new units etc have all been massively improved and gives a fresh breath, but the 2 foundational problems just ruins the experience and damages Relics efforts to get more people to contiinously play and support the game.",

There are too few players as well, you will spend a long time looking for players and most of them aren't very good too, as a COH2 veteran the COH2 has a lot more stuff, take the camos for instance in COH3 they are totally random and there are some kind camos that only apply to one unit! It's not like COH2 where they can applied to all vehicles, which in a COH looks weird in a development point of view like:\"So the Fallen Leaf camo only applies to 3 tanks and like 2 infantry units?\"; \"So I can't apply camos to the Tiger or Panther or King Tiger in the Wehrmacht but I can apply for the Tiger in the Afrika Corps but not for thr Ferdinand?\".

In my opinion they should start fixing the Cosmetics and do them like in COH2, that system was a Work Of Art!! Instead of launching an expansion and keeping the same problems. Now they came a long way for the Zero Day COH3 which was a copy and paste of COH2, unstable, cartoony and goofy at times. There are things that are really cool like: the sound effects, some of the visual effects, death animnations, vehicle wreckages, but still it leaves much to be desired in the UI and AI. Just fix the Cosmetics by making camos available for every unit including the Call Ability ones; Fix the AI omniscience; And another thing that really bothers me like hell is when the vehicles treads do not match their speed and it looks like they are floating or sliding like on the King Tiger.

         "Good Game! Was very hesitant to purchase when released as the reviews then were rampant with comments like a half baked game and it wasn't ready for release. So I waited until last year when it was 50 percent off, and since then I can't complain at all. I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.\n\nIf you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money. With my current hours and current invest into the game averages out to 0.75 cents and hour. How much value are people really going to cry about? They also gave \n free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. \n\nAll in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.  We can't except them to constantly work for free. \n\nThere are so many games that are released, review bombed and subsequently dropped and abandoned. OR we complain that releases aren't pushed fast enough, or updates and DLC aren't made quick enough, well we can't have our cake and eat it too. It takes massive amounts of time, energy, effort and money to produce these games. \n\nIr you like RTS games, WW2 and multiple games pick this up you won't disappointed. \n\n\n",
