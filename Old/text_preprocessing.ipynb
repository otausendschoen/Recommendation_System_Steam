These are all the currently main issues that affect me as a PVE only player.\n\n1. AI sucks, they're really easy to predict and usually only have a single build order. For example, they have a fixed rule of \"if vehicle is less than 20% hp, retreat to base regardless of situation\" and since the AI can see through FOW, units sometimes cower in cover before you see them, tanks run to the edges of the map.\n2. Modding has been severely limited in this game intentionally, leading to some mod devs to even choose to stay with CoH2.\n3. Worse atmosphere and audio, the lighting just seems off, voicelines are not memorable and some are recycled between units. We had faction specific main menu music, battle and victory themes in CoH2, it's the same every faction every game in CoH3.\n4. The new dlc, they are charging us half the price of the base game. Personally, even if this was a F2P game, locking more than half of the heavy tanks behind a dlc feels scummy. (DLC contains Pershing, Elefant, King Tiger and Churchill Crocodile. Base contains Churchill, it's variant Black Prince and Tiger.)\n5. The new CoH3 merit system. Complete challenges and supposedly earn battlegroups (the DLCs) and skins with the in game merit currency system. This was changed recently, battlegroups are now not earnable, the skin shop is just sad with very limited choices. Hundreds of hours spent on the merit challenges just to have the main reward silently taken away, mentioned only in one update post.\n\nMost of my time spent in CoH3 was earning merit challenges in boring games whereas in CoH2 I played for fun. At least for VS Ai players, I highly recommend staying with/getting CoH2 with mods. I cannot recommend enough All Units (170 added) mod by SneakEye and avoiding CoH3 for now.",

Balance is in a much better state as well as the game. The game is taking longer to reach where it needs to be now with a smaller team, but it is a team that cares. This game received too much hate on launch because people compared to an almost 20 year old coh1, and a 10+ year old COH2. But base game to base game COH3 had so much more content than either game on launch. And its bolstered on to it.\n\nWith new commanders coming it should breath new life into the game. Relic has been doing a great job to the improvement of the game. It is personally my favorite RTS to date. I highly suggest you try this game, and do it with an open mind as its style does differ from traditional coh titles. But once you grasp it, it just becomes that much more fun then it ever was before.\n\nThe only thing COH3 is lacking is commander diversity which will come in time, and once we hit that level of content, COH1 and 2 will become completely irrelevant. So give it a try, do so with an open mind, and lets keep our beloved franchise alive!",

Is it because the game isn't finished enough? \nWell kinda, but that's not my biggest issue with it.\n\n\nThe biggest issue is the cost. It's a very expensive game for what you get for it, and additionally, most of the content being added isn't included in the base game, but rather is half as expensive as the already-too-expensive game itself. Then to consider the fact that if you want a single 'battlegroup' as it were, you have to pay for other ones you may have zero interest in playing with, or trying. You HAVE TO pay for those other ones, to access the one you may want. \n\nBut what about the gameplay?\n\nIt's actually fun, in pvp. Unlike in CoH2 where players would always try to rush tanks and they would be nearly unstoppable, it's worth considering that the tanks are actually a lot more receptive to damage, especially from flanking, which makes positioning way more important than in previous titles (although it was important then as well). There are handy new QoL improvements, although your muscle memory of pressing T to retreat will get your squads killed because that standard button is now R. I'm not saying you CAN'T rush tanks and be unstoppable, but when you're getting your first tanks out, you have to be more careful with them, because infantry can do some serious damage, given the right equipment. \n\nI will say though, the Axis powers feel somewhat weak compared to their predecessors. I mean, where's the panzershreks? (Locked behind a paywall!)\n\nNow, onto the state of the game: \n\nIt's fun, but again, it feels unfinished. This is especially disappointing because the game has now been out for 2 years. Instead of more content for players who paid for the overly expensive game, there's content being monetized at half the cost of the base game itself. Formerly free content is also poised to become 'not free' and cost roughly half of that cost before the end of the month, if you didn't claim it before then. \n\nI understand the need to continue to have cash flow in the business, but overcharging for everything isn't going to do you any favors with your consumers, because there's other games (including your own former title) that, in spite of its own flaws, has a... better monetization scheme. Instead of $30 battlegroups that contain several that you may never touch, consider CoH2, where commanders would cost something like $3-4, and there were already plenty of them that were accessible to players who only owned the base game (not including the problematic nature of only having 2 of the factions available to play for free). \n\nLower the costs. Friends of mine tried the free weekend and refuse to pay the extreme cost of the game, even at a 50% discount due to how predatory the cost is, for what included content is available.",

I finished the DAK campaign and it was a total bore, with not a lot of interesting things or scenarios to play out.

The balance is also extremely wonky - some maps are pushovers, some are deathmarches that have you lose even if you micro well as the AI seems like it never loses resources nor men to throw at you.\n\nExtremely disappointing - unless you really wanna play multiplayer, dont buy this game.

Since the start of 2025, the number of exploits and cheats like fov expansion and fog of war removal has grown staggeringly. I come across this in every 2-3 matches and it's just a nuisance to play against. Artillery/Mortar on hidden units, nullifies your flanks, and then exploits your openings.\nRelic do have reporting system and claim to take action since the release of the fire & steel, but it's not the case, in fact, there is more cheats now than ever.  It is just not fun to play against. \n\nI don't like to throw accusations of cheats out there, but relics replay system and pov of the suspect makes it very easy to verify this, some don't even try to hid it in the first place... There have been numerous reddit posts about this and it's just so easy to cheat in this game it's wild. I will say cheats is THE biggest problem/hindrance for coh3 multiplayer \n\n[*]The unit exploits. It is no surprise to bring up blobbing in this franchise... but it is just sad in coh3. What's the point of diversifying units when you can just build 8 main line infantry, mgs, or any other of the same unit and throw them out all at once? I see it mainly with USF and riflemen (or rangers), Brits and crusaders, Werhm and mgs, Dakand Bersa. In low and high elo games there is no sense of strategy, just keep throwing a large volume of the same unit and you will have success.\n\nAt least in coh2 there were better counters to this, but Relic just can not find a way to balance this in coh3 despite them acknowledging the issue but making no real effort to solve it... It is a boring play style to play as or against in this game.\n[/olist]\n\nIn the end, I've always liked Relic as a studio, I do understand their constraints now being an independent studio and they do try to improve the game... but in the wrong way. Audio, graphics, new units etc have all been massively improved and gives a fresh breath, but the 2 foundational problems just ruins the experience and damages Relics efforts to get more people to contiinously play and support the game.",

There are too few players as well, you will spend a long time looking for players and most of them aren't very good too, as a COH2 veteran the COH2 has a lot more stuff, take the camos for instance in COH3 they are totally random and there are some kind camos that only apply to one unit! It's not like COH2 where they can applied to all vehicles, which in a COH looks weird in a development point of view like:\"So the Fallen Leaf camo only applies to 3 tanks and like 2 infantry units?\"; \"So I can't apply camos to the Tiger or Panther or King Tiger in the Wehrmacht but I can apply for the Tiger in the Afrika Corps but not for thr Ferdinand?\".

And the AI still has that nasty habit of VIEWING THE ENTIRE MAP ALL THE TIME, which is game breaking at times:\"Oh look I am assembling all my forces here far from the line of sight of the enemy... is that a airstrike and an artillary strike in the middle of the formation?!\". In my opinion they should start fixing the Cosmetics and do them like in COH2, that system was a Work Of Art!! Instead of launching an expansion and keeping the same problems. Now they came a long way for the Zero Day COH3 which was a copy and paste of COH2, unstable, cartoony and goofy at times. There are things that are really cool like: the sound effects, some of the visual effects, death animnations, vehicle wreckages, but still it leaves much to be desired in the UI and AI. Just fix the Cosmetics by making camos available for every unit including the Call Ability ones; Fix the AI omniscience; And another thing that really bothers me like hell is when the vehicles treads do not match their speed and it looks like they are floating or sliding like on the King Tiger. I just bought the game and every content to help them out, maybe they really want to fix it.",

So I waited until last year when it was 50 percent off, and since then I can't complain at all. I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.\n\nIf you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money. With my current hours and current invest into the game averages out to 0.75 cents and hour. How much value are people really going to cry about? They also gave \n free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. \n\nAll in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.  We can't except them to constantly work for free. \n\nThere are so many games that are released, review bombed and subsequently dropped and abandoned. OR we complain that releases aren't pushed fast enough, or updates and DLC aren't made quick enough, well we can't have our cake and eat it too.

      "\n",
      "✨ The Cake May Be a Lie, But the Brilliance is Real!\n",
      "Portal 2 isn’t just a game—it’s an intellectual playground that challenges your mind, tickles your funny bone, and immerses you in a world where physics, storytelling, and humor collide in perfect harmony. Valve took the innovative mechanics of the original Portal and expanded them into a fully fleshed-out masterpiece that still stands as one of the greatest games ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧩 Gameplay – A Brain-Bending Work of Art\n",
      "At its core, Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle-platformer where you use the iconic Portal Gun to place two linked portals on surfaces, allowing for mind-bending traversal and puzzle-solving. But Valve went beyond simple portals:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ New Mechanics – Exciting additions like Gels (speed, bounce, and portal-friendly surfaces), Light Bridges, Excursion Funnels, and Aerial Faith Plates elevate the puzzles to a whole new level.\n",
      "✅ Perfectly Paced Difficulty – The game introduces new mechanics gradually, ensuring you feel like a genius with every challenge you overcome.\n",
      "✅ Co-op Mode – The two-player cooperative campaign is an entirely separate story where teamwork is essential, leading to some of the best cooperative puzzle-solving in gaming history.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 Story & Characters – Witty, Dark, and Unforgettable\n",
      "Valve infused Portal 2 with one of the most brilliant narratives in gaming, blending dark humor, mystery, and sci-fi intrigue into a seamless experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎙️ GLaDOS (Ellen McLain) – The return of gaming’s most iconic AI villain is pure gold. Her sarcastic, passive-aggressive humor is sharper than ever, making her both a terrifying and hilarious presence.\n",
      "💡 Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) – The bumbling, dim-witted AI core brings comedic genius to the game, leading to some of the funniest dialogue ever written.\n",
      "🏢 Aperture Science’s History – The deeper dive into the Aperture Science facility and the tragic (yet hilarious) history of Cave Johnson (J.K. Simmons) adds layers of intrigue and absurdity to the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t just a puzzle game—it’s an intelligent, character-driven story with twists, turns, and unforgettable moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎶 Soundtrack & Atmosphere – Immersion at Its Finest\n",
      "🎵 Mike Morasky’s soundtrack is both eerie and mesmerizing, dynamically adjusting to your actions. And let’s not forget the legendary ending song, “Want You Gone,” which is just as iconic as Still Alive from the first game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The level design is stunning, transitioning from pristine test chambers to the rusty, forgotten depths of Aperture Science, making every environment feel unique and alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "🏆 Verdict – A Perfect 10/10 Experience\n",
      "✅ Mind-blowing puzzles that never feel repetitive.\n",

         "I still believe CoH2 is the superior choice currently, if you haven't tried/gotten used to the new QoLs in this game. These are all the currently main issues that affect me as a PVE only player.\n\n1. AI sucks, they're really easy to predict and usually only have a single build order. For example, they have a fixed rule of \"if vehicle is less than 20% hp, retreat to base regardless of situation\" and since the AI can see through FOW, units sometimes cower in cover before you see them, tanks run to the edges of the map.\n2. Modding has been severely limited in this game intentionally, leading to some mod devs to even choose to stay with CoH2.\n3. Worse atmosphere and audio, the lighting just seems off, voicelines are not memorable and some are recycled between units. We had faction specific main menu music, battle and victory themes in CoH2, it's the same every faction every game in CoH3.\n4. The new dlc, they are charging us half the price of the base game. Personally, even if this was a F2P game, locking more than half of the heavy tanks behind a dlc feels scummy. (DLC contains Pershing, Elefant, King Tiger and Churchill Crocodile. Base contains Churchill, it's variant Black Prince and Tiger.)\n5. The new CoH3 merit system. Complete challenges and supposedly earn battlegroups (the DLCs) and skins with the in game merit currency system. This was changed recently, battlegroups are now not earnable, the skin shop is just sad with very limited choices. Hundreds of hours spent on the merit challenges just to have the main reward silently taken away, mentioned only in one update post.\n\nMost of my time spent in CoH3 was earning merit challenges in boring games whereas in CoH2 I played for fun. At least for VS Ai players, I highly recommend staying with/getting CoH2 with mods. I cannot recommend enough All Units (170 added) mod by SneakEye and avoiding CoH3 for now.",

Balance is in a much better state as well as the game. The game is taking longer to reach where it needs to be now with a smaller team, but it is a team that cares. This game received too much hate on launch because people compared to an almost 20 year old coh1, and a 10+ year old COH2. But base game to base game COH3 had so much more content than either game on launch. And its bolstered on to it.\n\nWith new commanders coming it should breath new life into the game. Relic has been doing a great job to the improvement of the game. It is personally my favorite RTS to date. I highly suggest you try this game, and do it with an open mind as its style does differ from traditional coh titles. But once you grasp it, it just becomes that much more fun then it ever was before.\n\nThe only thing COH3 is lacking is commander diversity which will come in time, and once we hit that level of content, COH1 and 2 will become completely irrelevant. So give it a try, do so with an open mind, and lets keep our beloved franchise alive!",

Is it because the game isn't finished enough? \nWell kinda, but that's not my biggest issue with it.\n\n\nThe biggest issue is the cost. It's a very expensive game for what you get for it, and additionally, most of the content being added isn't included in the base game, but rather is half as expensive as the already-too-expensive game itself. Then to consider the fact that if you want a single 'battlegroup' as it were, you have to pay for other ones you may have zero interest in playing with, or trying. You HAVE TO pay for those other ones, to access the one you may want. \n\nBut what about the gameplay?\n\nIt's actually fun, in pvp. Unlike in CoH2 where players would always try to rush tanks and they would be nearly unstoppable, it's worth considering that the tanks are actually a lot more receptive to damage, especially from flanking, which makes positioning way more important than in previous titles (although it was important then as well). There are handy new QoL improvements, although your muscle memory of pressing T to retreat will get your squads killed because that standard button is now R. I'm not saying you CAN'T rush tanks and be unstoppable, but when you're getting your first tanks out, you have to be more careful with them, because infantry can do some serious damage, given the right equipment. \n\nI will say though, the Axis powers feel somewhat weak compared to their predecessors. I mean, where's the panzershreks? (Locked behind a paywall!)\n\nNow, onto the state of the game: \n\nIt's fun, but again, it feels unfinished. This is especially disappointing because the game has now been out for 2 years. Instead of more content for players who paid for the overly expensive game, there's content being monetized at half the cost of the base game itself. Formerly free content is also poised to become 'not free' and cost roughly half of that cost before the end of the month, if you didn't claim it before then. \n\nI understand the need to continue to have cash flow in the business, but overcharging for everything isn't going to do you any favors with your consumers, because there's other games (including your own former title) that, in spite of its own flaws, has a... better monetization scheme. Instead of $30 battlegroups that contain several that you may never touch, consider CoH2, where commanders would cost something like $3-4, and there were already plenty of them that were accessible to players who only owned the base game (not including the problematic nature of only having 2 of the factions available to play for free). \n\nLower the costs. Friends of mine tried the free weekend and refuse to pay the extreme cost of the game, even at a 50% discount due to how predatory the cost is, for what included content is available.",

COH was one of my favorite franchises and I figured that there had been sufficient time since launch for the bugs of the game to get ironed out. Also, I really enjoy playing the campaign of the game, even if the story can be uneven at times. So, I was looking forward to spending some time on this game...\n\n...I wish I had returned it.\n\nThe campaign is dull, uninspired and a bug-filled mess. I finished the DAK campaign and it was a total bore, with not a lot of interesting things or scenarios to play out. The story was abysmal and the characters feel like caricature of historical figures/peoples. \n\nThe Italian Campaign was worse story-wise, but at least I thought that the skirmish-type gameplay and random scenarios were at least somewhat less monotonous. I was even starting to enjoy the game slightly - but then I ran into a bug where a city would continuously get attacked and defended, but even if I win the battle the city would remain in enemy hands. The balance is also extremely wonky - some maps are pushovers, some are deathmarches that have you lose even if you micro well as the AI seems like it never loses resources nor men to throw at you.\n\nExtremely disappointing - unless you really wanna play multiplayer, dont buy this game.

Since the start of 2025, the number of exploits and cheats like fov expansion and fog of war removal has grown staggeringly. I come across this in every 2-3 matches and it's just a nuisance to play against. Artillery/Mortar on hidden units, nullifies your flanks, and then exploits your openings.\nRelic do have reporting system and claim to take action since the release of the fire & steel, but it's not the case, in fact, there is more cheats now than ever.  It is just not fun to play against. \n\nI don't like to throw accusations of cheats out there, but relics replay system and pov of the suspect makes it very easy to verify this, some don't even try to hid it in the first place... There have been numerous reddit posts about this and it's just so easy to cheat in this game it's wild. I will say cheats is THE biggest problem/hindrance for coh3 multiplayer \n\n[*]The unit exploits. It is no surprise to bring up blobbing in this franchise... but it is just sad in coh3. What's the point of diversifying units when you can just build 8 main line infantry, mgs, or any other of the same unit and throw them out all at once? I see it mainly with USF and riflemen (or rangers), Brits and crusaders, Werhm and mgs, Dakand Bersa. In low and high elo games there is no sense of strategy, just keep throwing a large volume of the same unit and you will have success.\n\nAt least in coh2 there were better counters to this, but Relic just can not find a way to balance this in coh3 despite them acknowledging the issue but making no real effort to solve it... It is a boring play style to play as or against in this game.\n[/olist]\n\nIn the end, I've always liked Relic as a studio, I do understand their constraints now being an independent studio and they do try to improve the game... but in the wrong way. Audio, graphics, new units etc have all been massively improved and gives a fresh breath, but the 2 foundational problems just ruins the experience and damages Relics efforts to get more people to contiinously play and support the game.",

There are too few players as well, you will spend a long time looking for players and most of them aren't very good too, as a COH2 veteran the COH2 has a lot more stuff, take the camos for instance in COH3 they are totally random and there are some kind camos that only apply to one unit! It's not like COH2 where they can applied to all vehicles, which in a COH looks weird in a development point of view like:\"So the Fallen Leaf camo only applies to 3 tanks and like 2 infantry units?\"; \"So I can't apply camos to the Tiger or Panther or King Tiger in the Wehrmacht but I can apply for the Tiger in the Afrika Corps but not for thr Ferdinand?\".

In my opinion they should start fixing the Cosmetics and do them like in COH2, that system was a Work Of Art!! Instead of launching an expansion and keeping the same problems. Now they came a long way for the Zero Day COH3 which was a copy and paste of COH2, unstable, cartoony and goofy at times. There are things that are really cool like: the sound effects, some of the visual effects, death animnations, vehicle wreckages, but still it leaves much to be desired in the UI and AI. Just fix the Cosmetics by making camos available for every unit including the Call Ability ones; Fix the AI omniscience; And another thing that really bothers me like hell is when the vehicles treads do not match their speed and it looks like they are floating or sliding like on the King Tiger.

So I waited until last year when it was 50 percent off, and since then I can't complain at all. I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.\n\nIf you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money. With my current hours and current invest into the game averages out to 0.75 cents and hour. How much value are people really going to cry about? They also gave \n free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. \n\nAll in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.  We can't except them to constantly work for free. \n\nThere are so many games that are released, review bombed and subsequently dropped and abandoned. OR we complain that releases aren't pushed fast enough, or updates and DLC aren't made quick enough, well we can't have our cake and eat it too. It takes massive amounts of time, energy, effort and money to produce these games. \n\nIr you like RTS games, WW2 and multiple games pick this up you won't disappointed. \n\n\n",

che succedono troppe cose riuscire mantenere una narrazione solida dall'inizio alla fine protagonisti sono sufficientemente caratterizzati ma niente di speciale L'incipit mi ha fatto quasi ridere

cambio y la dirección del juego se enfocaron en arreglar el desastre que fue cuando salióny merecen ese reconocimiento Pasaron 2 años desde su lanzamiento y el juego estaba incompleto todo este tiempo mejoró bastante y la verdad es muchísimo más divertido mejore faccione mejore grupos de batalla lo cual lo hace más dinámico comparación de la segunda entrega si bien hay más elemento por pulir como el sonido los devs dejaron en claro que seguirán haciendo caso las sugerencias de la comunidad sí desde su independencia como estudio se enfocaron en lo que pide la comunidad valga la redundancia en la próxima actualización se verán los cambios y mejoras que la comunidad solicitó Dentro de la jugabilidad es muchísimo mejor elemento como reforzar automáticamente los grupos de batalla variados los blindajes en los vehículos y el constante balance lo hace disfrutable El juego está yendo por buen camino y si ere fan del primer juego este te encantará si ere fan del segundo es probable que mucho

hell game break irritate silly valeu pena esperar para jogar Atualmente o jogo está em um ótimo momento bem otimizado e com diversas melhorias gráficas e na jogabilidade Apesar da CD Projekt ter decepcionado na pré venda acredito que hoje ele conseguiram deixar o jogo redondinho Para mim tornou se um dos melhore jogo que já joguei fez refletir diverti com inúmeras interaçõe com personagen bem construído e narrativa é simplesmente de tirar o fôlego com reviravolta incríveis e de muito bom gosto Além disso como apaixonado por arte fiquei impressionado com o quanto esse jogo entrega nesse aspecto o único ponto fraco na minha opinião é o balanceamento do inimigo Joguei hard e senti que ele são muito fracos enquanto os chefe da campanha são absurdamente mais fortis que os Cyberpsicopatas entanto sei que existem mod que ajudam equilibrar esse aspecto Peguei ele na promoção por 79,00R$ e pra mim valeu fiz 2 finais diferente e ainda tem muita coisa para explorar e divertir game quickly

world story gameplay come immersive unforgettable experience love open world game deep storytelling exciting gameplay definitely worth play fantastic game highly recommend cyberpeak 2077 Das beste Story Game ich jemal gespielt habe Ja das Spiel ist katastrophal gelauncht aber diesis Review bezieht sich auf den Jetzt Zustand auf PC und das GAME IST GEFIXXT Cyberpunk überzeugt mit seiner herausragenden Optik die Leuchreklamen die Werbung das Setting und vor allem die hohe Anzahl NPCs lassen die Stadt Night City lebendig erscheinen es ist bemerkenswert wie CD Projekt es geschafft hat eine Person City massiv rüberkommen zu lassen man fühlt sich wirklich wie einer dystopischen futuristischen Megastadt der die Corps mehr Macht al Behörden oder Regierungen haben Ein Grafikspektakel das es definitiv noch nicht gegeben hat die Welt detailliert und immersiv dass man sich wie ein Zeitzeuge vorkommt wobei die Performance nicht schlecht ist die Werbung die quasi überall zu finden ist beinhaltet geilen Erwachsenenhumor und scheint darzustellen will wir uns al Gesellschaft hinbewegen m Allgemeinen ist das Setting von Cyberpunk sehr interessant dynamische Wetter und vor Allem das Night Life machen das Spiel nochmal atmosphärischer Night City ist nicht einfach nur eine dahingeklatschte Stadt sondern hat Struktur es gibt verschiedene Viertel denen man verschiedene Leute antrifft Pacifica ist zwar paradisisch jedoch traut sich dort kein Polizist hin und es herrscht pure Chaos Verlassene Shopping Malls skyscraper usw Copo Plaza leben die Konzerner die Reichen Wolkenkratzer fliegene Taxis und große Straßen die Badlands eine Wüste die Night City umgibt ist voller Normaden und Plünderer die die Menschen bedrohen jeder einzelne Distrikt ist verschieden und hat viel Neues zum Entdecken es gibt viel zutun viele Anpassungsmöglichkeiten Das fängt schon bei den äußerlichen Merkmalen der Charaktererstellung will man wirklich alle auch das Genital beliebig anpassen kann eine quasi unendlich große Auswahl Kleidungsstile Außerdem kann man sich mehrere Wohnungen von billiig bis zu hoch luxuriös kaufen und immer wieder Neues entdecken Ein Porsche Night City um 2077 Gibt es gleich zwei Varianten und noch viele andere Autos genial ist auch dass man diese zu jeder Zeit zu sich rufen kann Taste V wer aber von langem Fahren aus GTA5 genervt ist wird hi seinen Spaß haben da es Quick Travel gibt Hacken ist einfach nur grandio und simple gelöst man kann Gegner entweder leise und auffällig umbringen oder mit viel Aufruhr die quickhack sind einfach zu verstehen und es gibt viele von ihnen dass ich auch nach 70h immer noch nicht alle kenne auto kontrollieren Gegner zum Suizid hacken und Granaten über gehackte Kameras aktivieren man kann seine Quickhacks erweitern und modifzieren waffen und granaten gibt es auch ohne Ende Bei den sogenannten Ripperdocs kann man seinen Körper anpassen und upgraden wodurch man Fähigkeiten wie double jump oder Klingen statt Fäuste freischalten kann Das Kämpfen ist super individuell und fördert dutzende spielstile looten kann man mögen oder nicht aber das Lootsystem diesem Spiel ist einfach nur perfekt Allgemein ist die Menüführung extrem einfach und man findet sich schnell zurecht Der Skill Tree ist einer der komplexesten die ich je gesehen habe aber gut ist man hat verschiedene Bereiche auf die man seinen Charakter leveln kann z. B. Hacken weaponhandle oder Movement Jeder Bereich beinhaltet um die 30 Upgrades die man frei wählen kann es gibt aber auch Upgrades die man durch reine Spielen freischaltet und nicht auswählen kann es gibt viele Dinge die man der Open World tun kann bar Clubs JoyToys xD Autorennen Verbrecherjagden und viele mehr Nun zu dem das Spiel zu einem wirklichen Meisterwerk macht die Charaktere und die Story die Charaktere sind tiefgreifend und jeder hat seine eigene Story die nahezu perfekt übermittelt wird Sie haben Emotionen Form von Mimik und Gestik die man kaum einem Spiel erlebt Das Interagieren mit den Charakteren ist ebenfall sehr gängig gestaltet und ruft verschiedene Reaktionen hervor Humor Ernsthaftigkeit und Bezüge zu vorher Passiertem machen die Konversationen lebendig und unterhaltsam Vor allem die Charaktere Johnny Silverhand Keanu Reeves Jackie und Panam sind perfekt geschriebene Charaktere die einen durch die Story begleiten Die Story ist das Herzstück des Spiels Sie ist komplex aber dennoch gut verständlich wenn man gut aufpasst ander al vielen anderen Spielen ist die Story jedoch nicht vorhersehbar einen sowohl schocken al auch faszinieren kann es gibt verschiede Anfänge der Story und verschiedene Wege wie die Story endet Das Auge fürs Detail hatten die Entwickler unterhalten sich NPCs über Geschehnisse die durch die Story NC passiert sind und auch narichtensender die man jedem Fahrstuhl unausweichlich hört thematisieren Story Relevantes Man kann Gigs machen die einen mehr das Stadtleben eindringen lassen Auch Nebenmissionen mit eigenen Charakteren gibt es die sowohl spannend sind al auch dazu beitragen die Welt von 2077 zu verstehen ich auch bemerkenswert finde ist die Synchro sowohl auf Deutsch al auch auf Englisch Man erkennt auf beiden Sprachen viele bekannte Synchronsprecher Das Auge fürs Detail ist nicht nur bei der Story mit Bord sondern auch wenn es um Easter Eggs die sich auf CD Projects Spiele wie witcher 3 beziehen geht Alles Allem für mich ein 10/10 Game da das Setting und die Story fesselnd und einzigartig sind die Welt von 2077 quasi unendlich lange erkundbar ist und die Charaktere Absolute Kaufempfehlung vor allem wenn es m Sale ist Das ist das Geld jeden Euro wert sofern man Open World Story Games mag Ein vergleichbare Spiel mit einer immersiveren Welt und tiefgreifenderen Charakteren gibt es einfach noch nicht Jackie good

pre launch oh que celui là va être difficile Je suis très partagé entre mettre un non recommandé trè sévère à cause du fait que même plusieur années et de multiples patchs après la sortie le jeu ne tient toujour pas ses promesse d'origine et mettre un recommandé enthousiaste parce que je suis quand même bien éclaté pendant plus de 100 heure et que je compte bien y rejouer à un moment J'imagine qu'il est plus honnête d'évaluer le jeu qui existe pour ce qu'il est plutôt que le jeu qui n'existe pas pour ce qu'il aurait pu être Du coup cyberpunk 2077 est un RPG très orienté action à la première personne dans lequel vous incarnez V le ou la mais je vais tout faire au masculin à défaut d'avoir du neutre mercenaire le plus malchanceux de Night City et pourtant y'en de la concurrence Suite à une mission beaucoup trop ambitieuse pendant laquelle il n'a vraiment pas de bol V va se retrouver avec dans la tête une copie 1:1 du rocker terroriste anarchiste egomaniac Johnny Silverhand menant une collaboration forcée des plus houleuse face aux megacorps d'un futur dystopique pas si lointain gro kiff Je vais passer assez rapidement sur le gameplay parce que même s'il est cool et dynamique ce n'est à mon sen pas la force principale du jeu cyberpunk 2077 étant un vrai RPG pur et dur y'a des level des stat des arbre de talent liés à ce stat et une progression verticale des plus vertigineuse qui va faire passer V de victime du quarti à machine de guerre immortelle capable d'annihiler des bataillon entiers de soldats d'élite en quelque second à peine Cette progression est renforcée par la possibilité d'upgrade le personnage avec du cyberware offrant des avantages variés du double saut à la capacité de ralentir le temps pendant quelque second en passant par le lame planquées dan les avant bras ou encore la possibilité de résister à un coup fatal en regagnant de la vie à la place Les possibilités de builds sont nombreuse le playstyle variés et que vous soyez du genre à vouloir tout exploser au machinegun à vous la jouer weeb en courant partout avec un katana ou encore à embrasser le délire netrunner à fond pour faire un perso totalement basé sur le hacking vous trouverez votre compte et le jeu fait vraiment en sorte que tous les style soient fun à jouer Là dessus c'est vraiment réussi déplorera possiblement que le jeu ne va pas assez loin dans certain délire pourtant très présent dans le ttrpg et oui Cyberpunk est avant tout un jeu de rôle papi comme les body mod complètement absurde ou encore la possibilité de devenir borg en même temp Le jeu aurait pu aller plus loin est un peu la critique principale que j'aurais à lui faire sur quasiment tous les aspect suffit pour le gameplay passon à ce qui selon moi est b]la[/b principale force du jeu la raison pour laquelle j'y ai passé plus de 100 heure et que je vais y revenir ce qui m'a fait acheter le jeu en premier lieu l'ambiance et la promesse d'écriture Witcher 3 m'avait déjà mis une grosse claque avec Novigrad que je considère encore aujourd'hui une des villes les plus réussie dans un jeu vidéo c'était grand ça faisait vrai mon immersion était totale Night City c'est ça en mieux si exclu les npc qui font des allers retour sur les passage piéton parce que leur routine dure 7 seconde Un aspect que je recherche particulièrement dan le rpg c'est leur capacité à m'immerger dan un univer qui est radicalement différent du mien C'est bien simple aucun jeu n'a aussi bien réussi que Cyberpunk sur ce point là Que ce soient l'ambiance visuelle l'identité forte des différent quartier les slang omniprésent créés spécifiquement pour le jeu les pub beaucoup trop fortis partout dans les rue les dinguerie qui arrivent au pif et donnent lieu à des quête secondaire impromptue TOUT participe à une immersion permanente et donne au jeu une cohérence et une identité propre est propulsé dans cet univer si proche et pourtant si éloigné du nôtre tout paraît si familier mais est pourtant si différent Je ne pourrais jamais insister assez sur la prouesse accomplie en terme de worldbuilde Jamais je n'avais aussi rapidement accepté un univer d'habitude je dis oh c' marrant sympa curieux comme manière de faire en voyant une utilisation inhabituelle de magie ou une technologie fictive je remarque la manière not les créateurs ont intégré au quotidien les éléments uniques de leur monde Ici je n'ai pas remarqué j'ai adopté Les technology fictive m'ont semblé naturelle et ce n'est qu'après coup après avoir arrêté de jouer que j'y ai pensé plus activement Là Ou Le Jeu Aurait Pu Aller Plus Loin(TM c'est sur le plan moral J'aurais aimé être plus dépaysé et être mis en face d'un spectre moral beaucoup plus gris où toute les nuance finissent par se mélanger Night City est censé être cet enfer dystopique dans lequel personne ne peut rester blanc tout le monde devrait avoir des squelette dans le placard et j'ai trop eu l'impression de croiser des NPCs sur la morale desquel moi depuis le confort de ma chaise et mon emploi stable pouvais m'aligner pour suivre dans cette ligne de pensée j'ai globalement trouvé le jeu trop propre Alors oui y'a un peu de gore y'a un peu de NSFW mais ça reste vachement en surface Encore une fois Night City est censé pousser le délire de la débauche et de la corruption à fond et tout est bien trop sage J'aurais aimé quitte à ce que ce soit une option qu'on puisse activer désactiver selon les sensibilités que l'aspect capitalisme débridé sans retenu qui en fait toujour trop soit plus présent en 2020 et quelque peut pas vendre un yaourt ou un parfum sans que la moitié des gen présent dans la pub soient à poil alor pourquoi le futur sombre où Amazon et Nestlé dirigent le monde fait preuve de plus de retenue Un jeu appelé CyberPUNK devrait plus bousculer et plus oser vous vous souvenez de la scène du Petit Batard dan Witcher 3 Je m'attendais à ressentir ce niveau d'inconfort beaucoup plus fréquemment dan Cyberpunk 2077 Surtout avec le tuto qui pour le coup fait vraiment le taf et fait une promesse en terme d'ambiance et d'atmosphère qui n'est malheureusement pas assez tenue Globalement mon ressenti de Cyberpunk 2077 est que c'est un bon jeu qui aurait pu être tellement mieux ce qui est dans le jeu est bon l'écriture est bonne les dialogue sont bon les personnage sont bon le gameplay est bon mais ce qui n'est PAS dans le jeu manque tellement que j'ai du mal à pleinement apprécier ce qui y est Les gen ne voient pas le détail ils remarquent l'absence de détail Shun Geek est une phrase qui m'est restée en tête depuis que je l'ai entendue ce niveau d'ambition et de production ce sont vraiment les détail qui font la différence entre un bon jeu et un excellent jeu et ce sont les détail qui manquent à Cyberpunk Ce sont le chose inutile et donc indispensable les chose not les jeux comme Red Dead Redemption 2 sont absolument truffés et qui témoignent d'un soin apporté que je ne retrouve tout simplement pas ici es verdad Cyberpunk 2077 es el juego que nos prometieron cuando se anunció pensé que sería un revolucionario juego en todos los aspectos algo nunca ante visto un ante y un despue pero la realidad es que un juego con unas mecánica ya vista y que juegos como GTA 5 que se lanzó mucho ante que Cyberpunk contiene más detalle en su mundo abierto que en el mundo abierto de Cyberpunk 2077 pero entonce qué es lo que hace tan especial Cyberpunk para haberse convertido en un juego tan aclamado la respuesta es por su historia los Cd Projekt saben contar historias saben de personajes las misiones son tan interesantes que sabe si es una principal o secundaria te invitan realizarla toda te obligan y te hacen vivir una interesante y genial historia en una ciudad que gráficamente se ve genial por eso recomiendo este juego por su historia su Game Play esta muy bien pero su fuerte es su historia recomendado 8.5/ 10 play launch Xbox Series X enjoy bug current level polish game insane got game launch

Yapılacak pek çok şey var Grafikler 10/10 Düşman ve map çeşitliliği 10/10 Geliştiricilerin uzun zamandır ilgisi ve bu zamana kadar bu oyunla ilgilenmesi 10/10 Umarım günümüz dünyasında sadece soul
