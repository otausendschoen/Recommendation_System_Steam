Company of Heroes 3,"Right, I believe I have played this game enough to be able to reliably comment on it. First of, I am a CoH series veteran, I was around long enough to have been painfully disapointed by CoH 2, a game that was so bad at launch it actually made one of my friends have an emotional episode over it and that speaks volumes about how passionate my friend group is about CoH. The first one, while amazing, has a great deal of issues, especially when you want to play multiplayer, be it PvP or Co-op, but has otherwise aged like fine wine and is worth the asking price for the campagin and mods alone. CoH 2 was released a piece of overpriced, unstable, unbalanced garbage, but was maintained until it just became unbalanced and messy (only so much you can do with an engine this bad) with a campagin that can only be described as 'buy the actually good single player content and sod off' (I am referring to the Ardennes Assault DLC, as base game campagin is so bad that it cannot be understated). I speak about these games because of the overwhelming number of comments that bring them up, though despite the near-perfection of CoH 1 and the messy and jank but popular CoH 2 I am willing to argue CoH 3 can finally stand shoulder to shoulder with them, even if it is far from perfect.
'But the reviews are mixed to this day' I imagine you asking in my head because I have an inner voice now, apparently, 'how can you prove that their arguments are bad/invalid and that yours are not?'. Well, let's take it from the top, shall we?
Exibit A): 'Game looks bad.' Now, lets think about this reasonably. Graphics are important for a game, yes, but when I say this I have stuff like visibility and readability in mind. Outside of that, stuff like aesthetics is purely subjective and can, thus, render a purely aesthetics-based argument moot, as when a game is readable, visible and well-presented, no matter how appealing the graphics are outside of that they do not really affect gameplay. I personally like the looks, especially the improved blood and gore effects, not to mention the game loads and runs immeasurably better than bleak and unoptimized CoH 2 or brown and drab CoH 1.
Exibit B): 'Campagin bad.' Yea, well, I don't really have a saving grace here, the dynamic campagin is a slog that made even the turtle extraordinare of our group, a seasoned Supreme Commander veteran say 'This is a bit much.' Good news is, Relic has been working on it and people have been saying nice things about it, so, hopefully, it gets better with time. As for the North Africa campagin, it is, for all intents and purpouses, simplistic and decent enough to play through once, but it lacks the punch of CoH 1 and the hilarious dissonance of CoH 2. You have no reason to play through it.
Exibit C): 'Balance bad.' Well, Relic, or Lelic as we call it in moments like these, is known for not knowing how to balance. Despite that, CoH 3 is far. FAR better balanced than CoH 1, where the brits could blow you up with artillery that had range that felt map-wide or could gain 100% map vision with some commando shenanigans, not to mention Panzer Elite and their shenanigans, CoH 2, where the SU-85 could spot for itself, thus removing the only real weakness of tank destroyers or the amount of clown-car based shenanigans most factions have access too, soviet fire spam, soviet instant-retreat propaganda artillery, brit sim cities, us rifle, pathfinder and jackson spam, penal and conscript ptrs spam, the magical Tiger II and many, MANY more examples of insane, unbalanced, absurd shenanigans that can decide the game for you 10 minutes in, CoH 3 actually has more in-deapth design with the battlegroups, allowing some flexibility and adaptablity, giving you a chance to come back with some strategy or double down on your advantage rather than leaving you in the dust as doctrines did in 2. Here lethality is higher at a distance than in 2 making long-range firefights less of a slog, all AT options are more lethal, thus making armour rush less dangerous that it was in 2, meaning a single light tank gotten a bit too early won't win you the game even if it costs it it's life and a single mass rout won't cost you the bulk of your army when they drive into your base and start rolling over your units (crushing was removed unless done to pinned units, a great change balance-wise). Do I think Italian Combined Arms is essentially a useless doctrine? Yes. Were Gustatori handled the wrong way since launch? Also yes. Brit infantry sections could tackle any issue, jaegers could too, so on and so forth, but these issues were adressed and are no longer. The devs care, they fixed strafes and loiters, they tackle bugs and pathfinding is the best it has been in any CoH game and don't even get me started on the UI, it's leaps and bonds ahead of the other games! True, CoH is still bad at explaining it's mechanics, but as people who did CoH professionally have taught me (people like Felinewolfie), that has been an issue consistently in every CoH game. This one lacks the levels and quantity of OP BS that the other two did and while that may change as battlegroups and, hopefully, factions roll out, at least all is fine for now, by comparison anyway.
Exibit D): 'DLC policy bad.' Do you hounestly expect me to defend 2 battlegroups for 17 euro as a DLC? Fat chance, people have every right to diss it and it should never have happened, I am happy the 2 new battlegroups released with 1.6.0 are not classed as DLC. I hope they learn from that and the next DLC is a faction or 2 with their own unique single player content.
TL;DR: Game runs very well, bugs are few and far in-between now and the rest are being squashed, saying the game looks bad is purely subjective as an argument and no grounds to hate on this game alone, balance is better than it has ever been with quality of life additions, but the DLC policy and campagin still need work. Give the game a try, you won't regeret it!

Company of Heroes 3,"I Pre-ordered the premium edition version of this game after putting hundreds of hours into COH2, a game that i loved and enjoyed for years... From the fun and re-playable coop missions to the almost overwhelming choice of commander/battlegroups... then COH3 releases and i could not feel more disappointed at state of the game. Absolutely pathetic choice of battlegroups, ZERO coop missions and not a sign or trace of seeing those glorious coop missions that we as a fanbase got to experience in COH2 anytime soon...  SHAME ON YOU RELIC! 

After over 2 years of updates and bugfixes to make it somewhat enjoyable they release the FIRE AND STEEL DLC that is 32.49$ CAD..... all of these battlegroups should be added to the base game. Absolute MONEY-GRABBING game development tactics.                                                SHAME ON YOU RELIC!

The devs should compensate the players who bought the premium addition and spent 20$ on the absolute Dinosaur doo-doo pile called HAMMER AND SHIELD and give them DLC for free. 

This game should have been released in early access with a 29.99 price tag.. pathetic. Even with the sour taste of Relics failures in my mouth i still continue playing COH3 while the RELIC slowly works towards giving us what should have been a finished product 2 years ago.

                                                                                   SHAME ON YOU RELIC!",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"They listed my GPU as supported and then quietly patched out support back in the first year, well after the refund window had passed. Absolutely heinous rug pull from a heinous company. This hot garbage is just stuck in my steam library but just crashes and they intend to do nothing about it. Money genuinely stolen.",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"CoH3 is where it's at. I've been playing CoH since CoH1 on a physical disc and really got into the multiplayer with CoH2. CoH3 takes the best from CoH1 and CoH2, then adds a healthy amount of its own uniqueness and cooks it all up into a fantastic entry into the franchise. This review is based primarily on the multiplayer experience.

To be clear, CoH3 did not have a good launch. It was released too early. Everyone can agree with that. Now, however, the game is in a fantastic state. Here are some key points that makes CoH3 the best game in the franchise.

- Every faction is unique, but all are equally competitive (obviously the current state of the game with balance patches can affect this to some degree)

- Every Battlegroup for each faction is completely unique and each faction will soon have 5 different ones to choose from. CoH1 had this uniqueness, but only 3 to choose from for each faction. CoH2 had the same abilities present amongst various different commanders which made many commanders not wholly unique.

- Every faction has multiple viable builds. For example, you might see a USF generic Rifle build, or they might go heavy support center. From there you might see a single greyhound, or you might see a chaffee or two. Maybe the USF player relies on halftracks more instead and maybe even skips motor pool entirely. Each game just feels very different because so many different builds are viable. It's a nice breath of fresh air from the CoH2 repetition of build 3-4 inf squads then rush light vic into ATG into medium armor. In CoH3 you have some games where medium armor never hits the field and it's all light vehicles all game. Or there are no light vehicles and it's a straight rush to medium armor. You even see top level players sometimes spending fuel on healing before their first light vehicle. The viability of different builds is one of the primary reasons this game is better than CoH1 and 2. In CoH2 a USF player that builds 3 Stuarts in a game and never techs T4 is memeing. In CoH3, a USF player that builds a Greyhound into 3 Chaffees might actually be doing the best thing for themselves in their situation.

- Faction design is amazing. 
-- UKF is mostly your generic COH faction, but even they have fun choices to be made throughout the game. Do you go early Dingo? Double Engineer or Vickers? Or neither and go all Rifle Sections? Maybe get out some Aussie Squads? All early game choices that are all viable in different situations.
-- Wehr is somewhat similar to CoH2 Soviets, but still with great MGs. Here, opening builds still vary a lot. Some go double pio, some go kettenkrad. Then is it 3-4 Grens? or 2 grens and an MG? Sometimes you see double MG. Then do you go Luftwaffe or Panzergrenadier HQ for your T2 building? I absolutely love all of the choices again here and how they all fit into different situations and approaches to the game
-- USF seemed the most one-dimensional at first, until the power of the WSC was discovered. Now you see some straight WSC openers with only support weapons and scouts/engineers. Of course, you still see many generic Rifleman builds. You also see a lot of mixed builds now too with riflemen and maybe a bazooka squad or two. Then you might see some halftrack play, or you'll see some motor pool. Again, very fun choices to be amde.
-- Then there's DAK. For any COH1 vets out htere, DAK is if Panzer Elite was made the right way. They are very light vehicle and mechanized focused, but they are not broken. The variety in viable builds is probably greatest with DAK and is one of the most interesting factions to play for that reason imo. 

- The game is still receiving balance patches and DLC. 4 new Battlegroups are set to release this month. New maps are added once or twice a year. Balance is tweaked regularly, but not so often that you can't learn and adapt your builds.

If you're still on the other side of the fence about this, just auto-vault over and give it a try. The gameplay is fun and the decision making is so compelling that I can honestly never go back to the other games in the franchise. I truly believe Relic have hit their mark with this game and I cannot recommend it enough.",True,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"An underwhelming, expensive cash grab. Very low content, super meta units, very high prices and insanely low grade DLC that cost 1/3 or 1/2 the price of the game. Awful balancing for multiplayer.",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"CoH3 is a good game with a rocky start. with all of the updates its really starting to shine but some things still fail to meet CoH2. Some maps are to small and the ticket count change doesn't sit right with me. Match's most times never hit the big battles you had in CoH2 but that isn't all bad. 

I like CoH3 and its my favourite of the 3. the game looks amazing and sounds great. 

Give it shot but try not to play it like CoH2, its not 2, its 3. 

i give CoH3 a soild 7.5/10 with room for improvement.

Company of Heroes 3,"Game had a tough launch and deserved its criticism, but all of the glaring issues have been fixed. Very fun game that has moved the series forward in a way that makes the older games very difficult to go back and play. At this point, the game is well worth the money at full price. Sure, occasionally balance is out of whack and can be frustrating... but that is what you get with an RTS that is still putting out new content/units. Overall the game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend for all those interested in skirmish/multiplayer 

**Disclaimer: I completed both campaigns at launch and thought Italian was ""solid"" but way too repetitive, while the African campaign was ""meh"" because it was bare bones and pretty short.  I have not touched either campaign since completing them when game was released - no clue if the improvements have made the game worth the $$ for players that are primarily interested in single player campaigns.**",True,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"I still believe CoH2 is the superior choice currently, if you haven't tried/gotten used to the new QoLs in this game. These are all the currently main issues that affect me as a PVE only player.

1. AI sucks, they're really easy to predict and usually only have a single build order. For example, they have a fixed rule of ""if vehicle is less than 20% hp, retreat to base regardless of situation"" and since the AI can see through FOW, units sometimes cower in cover before you see them, tanks run to the edges of the map.
2. Modding has been severely limited in this game intentionally, leading to some mod devs to even choose to stay with CoH2.
3. Worse atmosphere and audio, the lighting just seems off, voicelines are not memorable and some are recycled between units. We had faction specific main menu music, battle and victory themes in CoH2, it's the same every faction every game in CoH3.
4. The new dlc, they are charging us half the price of the base game. Personally, even if this was a F2P game, locking more than half of the heavy tanks behind a dlc feels scummy. (DLC contains Pershing, Elefant, King Tiger and Churchill Crocodile. Base contains Churchill, it's variant Black Prince and Tiger.)
5. The new CoH3 merit system. Complete challenges and supposedly earn battlegroups (the DLCs) and skins with the in game merit currency system. This was changed recently, battlegroups are now not earnable, the skin shop is just sad with very limited choices. Hundreds of hours spent on the merit challenges just to have the main reward silently taken away, mentioned only in one update post.

Most of my time spent in CoH3 was earning merit challenges in boring games whereas in CoH2 I played for fun. At least for VS Ai players, I highly recommend staying with/getting CoH2 with mods. I cannot recommend enough All Units (170 added) mod by SneakEye and avoiding CoH3 for now.",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"Still clunky, feels both slow as molasses and too fast at the same time somehow (troops move slowly, ranges feel basically point-blank, but the damage output forces you to constantly retreat, meaning you can't actually hold a line). 

I prefer slower build-up games and this just isn't it. It's all about trying to get the match done as rapidly as possible. If you like to sweat in your RTS and not actually build up anything or have time to actually learn the intricacies of your battlegroups, then sure have fun blobbing in it. But I just don't like it and regret the purchase. Even after the 2.0 patch it just feels like a shell of a full RTS.

Returning players will appreciate the update to the Commander system from CoH2 which was a series of linear unlocks. Battlegroups are an update to the Doctrine system from CoH1, two branches offering exclusive  choices which determine your playstyle. 

Relic have worked on CoH3 continuously since launch, even updating the campaign, free MP and single player skirmish maps and new battlegroups for players since 1.0 with Hammer and Shield and more content to come in 2025 and plans for 2026. 

North Africa and Italy are a refreshing change, offering  dynamic open spaces in Tunisian desert landscapes and verdant rolling landscapes in the Italian theatre.

Company of Heroes 3,"I've been a fan of coh & relic since the release of coh2.
Relic have made considerable improvements in coh3, Love the game-play, audio and graphics but the main attraction, the multiplayer is just in a constant terrible state and I just can't recommend the game because of it.

There are two areas that just ruins multiplayer:
[olist]
[*] The cheats. Since the start of 2025, the number of exploits and cheats like fov expansion and fog of war removal has grown staggeringly. I come across this in every 2-3 matches and it's just a nuisance to play against. Artillery/Mortar on hidden units, nullifies your flanks, and then exploits your openings.
Relic do have reporting system and claim to take action since the release of the fire & steel, but it's not the case, in fact, there is more cheats now than ever.  It is just not fun to play against. 

I don't like to throw accusations of cheats out there, but relics replay system and pov of the suspect makes it very easy to verify this, some don't even try to hid it in the first place... There have been numerous reddit posts about this and it's just so easy to cheat in this game it's wild. I will say cheats is THE biggest problem/hindrance for coh3 multiplayer 

[*]The unit exploits. It is no surprise to bring up blobbing in this franchise... but it is just sad in coh3. What's the point of diversifying units when you can just build 8 main line infantry, mgs, or any other of the same unit and throw them out all at once? I see it mainly with USF and riflemen (or rangers), Brits and crusaders, Werhm and mgs, Dakand Bersa. In low and high elo games there is no sense of strategy, just keep throwing a large volume of the same unit and you will have success.

At least in coh2 there were better counters to this, but Relic just can not find a way to balance this in coh3 despite them acknowledging the issue but making no real effort to solve it... It is a boring play style to play as or against in this game.
[/olist]

In the end, I've always liked Relic as a studio, I do understand their constraints now being an independent studio and they do try to improve the game... but in the wrong way. Audio, graphics, new units etc have all been massively improved and gives a fresh breath, but the 2 foundational problems just ruins the experience and damages Relics efforts to get more people to contiinously play and support the game.",False,Strategy

COH3 has a lot of potential despite its immature release, it took a long time to get at where it is now but honestly props to the Dev's and staff of Relic as they had to earn there respect as an effective fun RTS Game Company. I have a lot of respect for relic and there hard work keep it up please. In the future I hope they start adding more utility to units and as well as more light medium vehicle option for example a Bren Carrier would be really cool for British.

Company of Heroes 3,"Good Game! Was very hesitant to purchase when released as the reviews then were rampant with comments like a half baked game and it wasn't ready for release. So I waited until last year when it was 50 percent off, and since then I can't complain at all. I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.

If you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money. With my current hours and current invest into the game averages out to 0.75 cents and hour. How much value are people really going to cry about? They also gave 
 free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. 

All in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.  We can't except them to constantly work for free. 

There are so many games that are released, review bombed and subsequently dropped and abandoned. OR we complain that releases aren't pushed fast enough, or updates and DLC aren't made quick enough, well we can't have our cake and eat it too. It takes massive amounts of time, energy, effort and money to produce these games. 

Ir you like RTS games, WW2 and multiple games pick this up you won't disappointed.

[b]2. Early and Mid game balance issue: [/b] with the new 2.0 update, the meta certainly changes. I haven't played much to know for sure which spam got buffed and which got nerfed. So far I only found new USF half-track spam since they got cheaper (or maybe I have been playing on low ELO for too much I rarely find this spam)

[b]3. Replay watch sync-error issue: [/b] Issue addressed I think? Haven't found any replay errors yet.

[b]4. Auto-match balance issue: [/b] I might be biased but I think it's been fixed as well. Tho someone certainly need to make tutorial to teach the Axis newbies how to deal with early Allies light tank/armored car rush coz I see them getting their ass handed immediately once it happens.

[b]5. Can't buy the 4th battlegroup of wehrmacht and USF factions in-game with merits without the corresponding DLC: [/b] The in-game UI has been fixed. It now tells you to buy the DLC to buy the battlegroup. Just like the new fire & steel battlegroups.

[b]6. Rapido River Crossing bugs: [/b] I still haven't tried this map again. It used to have a lot of bugs that can happen in this map so I always have it downvoted. examples are: breach cannot finish so unit gets stuck doing nothing, AT gun crews out of action but the AT gun itself still capable of moving around and attack with 0 HP.

Company of Heroes 3,"The issue to why over 1k more players are on CoH2 vs CoH3 is rather easy to explain.

Just look at how they setup the community spaces, discord, etc.
There is no substance for an easy access community.
Online multiplayer setup is basic and doesn't build interactions, should have in-game voice by now, it would significantly help strategy, but... instead of focusing on multiplayer and community......
John and his team gutted the game and went with single player campaign and cut-scenes that wasted all the money, time and talent.
You know, instead of building on top of, what was already a great game.
THEY FOCUSED ON THE WRONG THINGS.

 CoH3 went hard left field to be ""Different"" and failed.

They could have taken CoH2 + graphic touch ups, same audio, and added some B/s factions just for flavor, maybe even introduced sea/air units......  transport troops across the sea or something, naval battles for extra supply/fuel, like legit there is a Ton to work with.

Instead, they limit the players ability to manipulate/customize their army, and pretty much killed the game. These no substance update/battlegroups are NOT the answer.
We could have 20 battlegroups each faction just by allowing the community to make them, then absorb and test/edit/implement. Common sense tho.

Read any forum or comment section and a monkey could have picked all this up way long ago.... like prior/during development. Now here we are, no active players, no community, game is over priced. But the cartoony cut scenes, oooooh weee soooo coool.

Company of Heroes 3,"I purchased this game for the Christmas holidays last year. COH was one of my favorite franchises and I figured that there had been sufficient time since launch for the bugs of the game to get ironed out. Also, I really enjoy playing the campaign of the game, even if the story can be uneven at times. So, I was looking forward to spending some time on this game...

...I wish I had returned it.

The campaign is dull, uninspired and a bug-filled mess. I finished the DAK campaign and it was a total bore, with not a lot of interesting things or scenarios to play out. The story was abysmal and the characters feel like caricature of historical figures/peoples. 

The Italian Campaign was worse story-wise, but at least I thought that the skirmish-type gameplay and random scenarios were at least somewhat less monotonous. I was even starting to enjoy the game slightly - but then I ran into a bug where a city would continuously get attacked and defended, but even if I win the battle the city would remain in enemy hands. The balance is also extremely wonky - some maps are pushovers, some are deathmarches that have you lose even if you micro well as the AI seems like it never loses resources nor men to throw at you.

Extremely disappointing - unless you really wanna play multiplayer, dont buy this game. Even then - COH2 is a much more polished product + cheap as chips nowadays.

A disappointing sequel to a disappointing sequel. 
Coh2 was inferior to the first game, but still a pretty alright game that was worth playing. Coh3 is just mid. It feels like a low effort sequel that just copies Coh2 with less content. Supposedly there were a tone of bugs and balance issues, but I wasn't around for that and there has been patching. I haven't delved into the multiplayer so let's see what it has to offer for SP content.
Well it contains 2 different campaigns. The dynamic Italy campaign similar to the ardens DLC for coh2, and a more traditional North Africa Campaign for the Axis. This is the better of the two. My only issues are the fact that its short, and the story focuses on some family of african partisans that is rather detached from the main missions. 

As for the Italy campaign (which is the main focus) is where the game is a mess. While they did expand it from the ardens DLC, changing it to have more of a grand strategy feel, oh boy is it not good. For starters the difficulty curve is all over the place. Starting it can be the hardest part because of how little resources you have to work with, and it soon becomes obvious the enemy doesn't play by the rules. Later on it gets real repetative because to capture territory you have to play out a battle. The major territories have proper missions, and most of these are fine. The problem is the other occupied zones you have to play repetitive multiplayer style skirmishes... If I wanted to play those I would play multiplayer. And what's worse, there is no option for auto resolve like say.. total war. It get's real old. The breaking point for me is when I won one of these and the game didn't register the capture. After that I just rushed for the endgame. Yeah it's not good.
I didn't bother with the dlc as it looked like a rip off. Oh, and the story is goes out of its way (with awful low budget cut scenes I might add) to continue to inject women into WW2. Like, we get it. there were some women in certain partisan groups and the soviet army, but not to the point to that these games that are desperate to re wright history try to portray. Though its not as in your face about it as Vanguard and Battlefield V were. Stop trying to inject fake diversity into WW1 and 2

The online part of the game has become more challenging than the previous two versions and unlike Coh2, in Coh3 your smallest mistakes can be irreparable and end in defeat.

I like this difficulty in the online part of the game, but I feel that it makes new players frustrated. To put it more briefly, the online part of the game is not suitable for new players and if a player is not willing to endure repeated failures and humiliation to learn, he will probably give up the game very soon.

Counter-Strike 2,"Unfortunately, it is truly a great game ruined by cheaters.

I had a very long break from CS (and gaming in general), so I was pretty excited to get back and enjoy the gameplay. That happened to be impossible as in at least 20% of your games you'll match up against someone cheating.
Back in 2014-2017 you would also occasionally meet someone cheating, but usually on higher ranks such as LE, LEM, SMFC, GE, that's why (I think) they cheated in the first place — to get to higher ranks and stay there.

Downloading CS years later (and having 0 skill left) I was surprised to find out that now you have silvers and novas flooded with cheaters, which makes 0 sense to me — What is those guys' goal? Why are they ranked so low using cheats? So, in 2025 cheating is not something you occasionally find among high-ranks competing between each other, but rather an issue you simply cannot avoid. Among other things, this makes the game very unfriendly for newbies who expect to play against someone in their skill bracket.

Someone might say ""you are just bad and that's why you think others cheat"" and while I get this POV, it is simply not the case. I might not be good anymore but I certainly remember the game's physics and stuff like that. It's quite easy to detect a cheater when you played the game for the first time in 2003. (Also, a 0 level, 1 year old, 50 hours in game Steam account having 80% HS% is simply something very, very suspicious).

Also someone might say ""just don't play on Valve's servers, go to FACEIT"". Firstly, I just want to casully play the game for an hour to relax, not to be all 'competitive' and ruin other's desire to win. Secondly, why can't the game be playable ""out of the box"" with no need to have any kind of 'add-ons'?

Ah, Counter-Strike 2. The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—a game we all spent years complaining about.

First, let's talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what it’s like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2’s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like you're guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galore—it’s like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.

Then, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piece—nice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesn’t work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. It's almost impressive.

But don’t worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokes—because that’s what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.

Meanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesn’t make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.

Counter-Strike 2,"Performance and Optimization Nightmare ""our cs2 experience""
When Counter-Strike 2 was first teased, there were high hopes. The game was supposed to be more ""next-gen,"" with improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and advanced technology that should’ve pushed the franchise into the future. Unfortunately, what we got instead feels like a rushed, undercooked product. Even with a top-tier gaming PC—one that comfortably runs CS:GO at high frame rates—I’m seeing Counter-Strike 2 stutter and lag. It’s as if the game is trying to push something it’s not ready for. FPS drops occur regularly, and the frame rates plummet during high-intensity moments, something that simply wasn’t an issue in its predecessor. The optimization is absolutely terrible.

To make matters worse, there’s an issue with how the game allocates resources. I’ve seen instances where my GPU usage is well below 60%, and my CPU spikes, all while the game stutters to keep up. The result? A frustrating, broken experience where you’re constantly fighting against the game's inherent performance flaws. That might be something you can tolerate in an early beta, but this is the full release, and it's completely inexcusable. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got an RTX 3090 or the latest Intel chip, the game will make you feel like you’re playing on an ancient machine.

Inconsistent Hit Registration and Broken Mechanics
Counter-Strike has always been about precision and skill. A large part of its charm comes from that skill-based combat, where landing shots is directly tied to your aim and timing. But with Counter-Strike 2, the game has broken that core principle.

The so-called “sub-tick” system is a mess. For those who aren’t familiar, this was introduced as a way to improve server tick rates and reduce lag-related issues. Instead of improving things, it has made hit registration feel wildly inconsistent. I’ll be facing an enemy at close range, unload an entire magazine, only to see my shots whiff completely. There’s a delay between the time I pull the trigger and when the shots actually register, and this isn’t just occasional—it’s constant.

You’ll find yourself dying around corners where you’re certain you had the angle, or getting one-tapped by enemies whose bullets seem to bend through walls. It’s not just frustrating, it’s completely maddening. The fundamental mechanics that once made the series great are in shambles. What’s the point of precision aiming when the game itself can’t get the basics right?

Cheating Epidemic: A Competitive Nightmare
One of the most frustrating things about Counter-Strike 2 is the fact that Valve has somehow failed to address the cheating problem in any meaningful way. Aimbots, wallhacks, speed hacks, you name it—cheaters are running rampant in this game, and there’s no real effort to stem the tide.

I’ve spent more time in matches recently reporting players than actually enjoying the game. And even when you do report someone, there’s no guarantee anything will be done about it. Valve’s anti-cheat system feels like a joke, especially when you encounter blatant cheaters who have no fear of being caught. It’s ruining the game’s competitive integrity. What’s the point of trying to be good at a game when your opponents can essentially toggle on god-mode cheats and you’re left helpless?

It’s so bad that I’ve been in matches where cheaters completely dominate, and no one can do anything about it. It destroys the fun of playing competitively. It’s all the more upsetting because Counter-Strike used to be a title where competitive fairness was sacred. Now, it feels like a free-for-all, where cheating is normalized and punished rarely—if at all.

Content Removal: The Soul of Counter-Strike is Gone
One of the biggest slaps in the face to longtime fans is the removal of classic content and game modes. Gone are the beloved modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone, which added variety and fun to the game when you wanted a break from competitive matches. These modes helped flesh out CS:GO, offering something different when the typical 5v5 match just didn’t cut it. Now, with Counter-Strike 2, those modes are mysteriously absent, leaving a void that no amount of new skins or maps can fill.

On top of that, the removal of support for macOS was a baffling decision. Many players in the community, including myself, used to play on Macs, and this sudden exclusion has left a large portion of the fanbase unable to even play the game. For a game that has prided itself on being accessible, this is a huge step back.

Lack of Communication and Developer Inaction
Valve's silence is deafening. The community has voiced its concerns repeatedly, yet the developers have remained almost entirely mute. No clear updates, no explanations for why the game is in the state it’s in—just radio silence. Players are being left in the dark, wondering whether Valve even cares about fixing the game or if they’re just going to move on to the next big title.

This lack of communication has only fueled the anger within the community. We’ve seen them take months to address even the most basic issues, and the fear that Counter-Strike 2 will continue to be neglected is growing every day. The franchise has always had a strong relationship with its fanbase, but that’s rapidly eroding as Valve continues to push out half-baked updates and ignores player feedback.

The State of the Community
Perhaps one of the most disheartening aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is the state of its community. The game has become a toxic wasteland, with constant cheating, connection issues, and poor matchmaking experiences. The player base is frustrated and demoralized, and it shows in how people behave during matches. Once, the competitive nature of CS brought out the best in players, creating an environment of skill and camaraderie. Now, it’s all about getting through the match without tearing your hair out.

The introduction of the new matchmaking system has only made things worse. The rankings feel inconsistent, and there are so many smurf accounts—players intentionally playing at lower levels to dominate newbies—that it’s impossible to climb without running into wall after wall. It’s made the competitive scene feel pointless, with no real progression.

In Conclusion: A Franchise in Decline
After hundreds, maybe thousands of hours spent in the Counter-Strike series, I never thought I’d be here, completely disillusioned and frustrated with the state of the game. Counter-Strike 2 has taken everything that made the franchise great and run it into the ground. What was supposed to be a promising evolution of the series has instead resulted in an unoptimized, broken, and increasingly unpopular title.

It’s hard to recommend the game to anyone anymore. I still have hope that Valve will turn things around, but with each passing update, it feels more like they’re ignoring the core issues that the community is pleading for them to address. Until that happens, Counter-Strike 2 remains an absolute disaster of a release—unplayable, unbalanced, and unrecognizable as the game we all loved.",False,Strategy
Counter-Strike 2,"Counter-Strike has ruined many relationships and people in general. From crippling gambling addictions, to pure rage from getting destroyed, taking away maps and or tweaking game play, playing cheaters all the time, the list goes on. So people just lost their gosh darn minds.

Counter-Strike 2,"[h1]Honest CS2 Review from a player with a combined 10 years of CS experience, across all games. Yes, even Nexon.[/h1]

CS2 is.... so god damn bittersweet to play. The graphics and particles, are amazing. Truly something I would've only dreamed of when I was an 11 year old boy and played CS:GO for the first time. The skins look better than ever with this new revamped lighting, and it's easier than ever to get into the game.

[h2]The new and ""improved"" ranking system[/h2] 

To call this system improved is... a half truth. Yes, it's more specific to maps, but also makes it EXTREMELY difficult to truly keep track of your skill level, unless you exclusively play premier. This also kinda segues into my issue with the SBMM in normal competitive mode, as if ONE person on your team is Gold Nova on that map, and the rest of you are unranked or Silver 1, the odds of the enemy team having multiple players matching your most powerful player's skill level is very high. 

[h2]The bugs. Dear Christ, the bugs.[/h2]

Where in the name of Christ do I start? For every bug fixed from CS:GO, 2 more appear in this game. Sure, most of them get patched quickly, but the ones that stay are absolutely foul. It's not uncommon for your game to get stuck in the ""CT Side"" or ""T Side"" opening cutscene, rendering you useless until you rejoin the match. 

WHICH, leads me to the next point. Sometimes, (more often than not) should you have to rejoin a competitive or premier match, clicking ""reconnect"" has a very high chance of registering your click, starting the loading timer, but not loading you in. It will seriously sit there and count for the entirety of your re-join timer, at which point it will give you an abandonment cooldown. This can only be fixed by restarting your entire game and trying to connect again, BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT, or very quickly cancelling the load by leaving the party, and clicking ""reconnect"" again.

 [h2]Bots. All the bots. More robots than an unmanned assembly line up in here.[/h2] 

Whether you join a casual match and find a bot-farm match, kicking you almost immediately, or you have someone on your comp queue that has an autoclicker simply to avoid an idling kick so they can farm XP, there is no shortage of bots in this game unless you're full-stacked in a competitive gamemode, or you avoid Deathmatch, Casual, and Arms Race altogether outside of private matches. Admittedly, this problem has lessened in the past couple months. 

 [h3]Summary[/h3]

Despite my harsh words about the game, I think most of it's downfalls can be attributed to it's somewhat rushed release. If this game wasn't damn near Cyberpunk level rushed, I doubt I'd have much to talk about here. All in all, it's still the same old CS you know and love if you're looking for a competitive FPS game to kill time with some friends and hear users from around the world call you slurs you've never even heard of.

Counter-Strike 2,"tl;dr: Great game, good community, bad cheaters

Counter-Strike 2 is a great game and, in my opinion, a worthy successor to CS:GO—despite the somewhat strange shooting mechanics. Since the introduction of Subtick, every one-tap feels amazing, but spraying feels incredibly random, which is further amplified by the damage prediction system.

I’ve personally tested the new damage prediction for over 200 hours, and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it feels more responsive; on the other, about a third of the shots result in fake dinks or fake hits. This is especially frustrating when spraying: you see a fake dink, stop shooting because you think you’ve hit the enemy properly, and then end up dying because of it.

That covers the “CS2 vs. CS:GO update” part.

Now, onto the really good aspects: CS2 is an excellent example of a well-designed 5v5 competitive FPS. The core gameplay feels great, and the movement is some of the best I’ve ever seen in an FPS. Meeting new people, playing casual game modes with friends—or even alone—can be really fun! Improving your skills, seeing your progress, and facing increasingly difficult opponents is a rewarding experience.

CS2 perfectly embodies the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master.” Even the best players in the world still have room to improve!

Now, another downside: cheaters. First of all, the situation has improved. But at the same time, it still doesn’t feel truly fixed. Some players are blatantly rage cheating yet remain unbanned. I’ve watched multiple Wingman demos where opponents are locking onto my head—even through walls and smokes—bunny-hopping flawlessly across the map, and wallbanging my teammate and me like crazy. And yet, they’re still not banned. Ridiculous. All we can do is wait for Overwatch to be rolled out to more players.

I could probably go on forever, but I’ll wrap it up here.

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]PUBG – The Battle Royale That Started It All[/h1]

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★

PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

Survival & Tension: ★★★★★

Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆

While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.

Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆

KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.

Overall Verdict:

PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters.",True,Strategy

The original Battle Royale. PUBG's name will be echoed for generations as a cultural milestone that paved the way for all future BR's released to this day. What a wonderful game this was during its prime, little to no flaws in terms of performance and game mechanics. Every match is as stressful as it is rewarding. Unfortunately it just barely misses the perfect score for a few reasons. PUBG's downfall is one that should be studied by all future game developers. The reason for this downfall being BR's such as Fortnite and Apex at their peaks respectively. This wasn't because of quality or accessibility (Even though PUBG is notorious for poor performance on console.) but rather its price. PUBG did everything right, aside from removing that price tag sooner. The pride PUBG held for its lovechild was ultimately its downfall, with so many other free options, why convince friends to spend the thirty dollars on PUBG?

Company of Heroes 3,"Right, I believe I have played this game enough to be able to reliably comment on it. First of, I am a CoH series veteran, I was around long enough to have been painfully disapointed by CoH 2, a game that was so bad at launch it actually made one of my friends have an emotional episode over it and that speaks volumes about how passionate my friend group is about CoH. The first one, while amazing, has a great deal of issues, especially when you want to play multiplayer, be it PvP or Co-op, but has otherwise aged like fine wine and is worth the asking price for the campagin and mods alone. CoH 2 was released a piece of overpriced, unstable, unbalanced garbage, but was maintained until it just became unbalanced and messy (only so much you can do with an engine this bad) with a campagin that can only be described as 'buy the actually good single player content and sod off' (I am referring to the Ardennes Assault DLC, as base game campagin is so bad that it cannot be understated). I speak about these games because of the overwhelming number of comments that bring them up, though despite the near-perfection of CoH 1 and the messy and jank but popular CoH 2 I am willing to argue CoH 3 can finally stand shoulder to shoulder with them, even if it is far from perfect.
'But the reviews are mixed to this day' I imagine you asking in my head because I have an inner voice now, apparently, 'how can you prove that their arguments are bad/invalid and that yours are not?'. Well, let's take it from the top, shall we?
Exibit A): 'Game looks bad.' Now, lets think about this reasonably. Graphics are important for a game, yes, but when I say this I have stuff like visibility and readability in mind. Outside of that, stuff like aesthetics is purely subjective and can, thus, render a purely aesthetics-based argument moot, as when a game is readable, visible and well-presented, no matter how appealing the graphics are outside of that they do not really affect gameplay. I personally like the looks, especially the improved blood and gore effects, not to mention the game loads and runs immeasurably better than bleak and unoptimized CoH 2 or brown and drab CoH 1.
Exibit B): 'Campagin bad.' Yea, well, I don't really have a saving grace here, the dynamic campagin is a slog that made even the turtle extraordinare of our group, a seasoned Supreme Commander veteran say 'This is a bit much.' Good news is, Relic has been working on it and people have been saying nice things about it, so, hopefully, it gets better with time. As for the North Africa campagin, it is, for all intents and purpouses, simplistic and decent enough to play through once, but it lacks the punch of CoH 1 and the hilarious dissonance of CoH 2. You have no reason to play through it.
Exibit C): 'Balance bad.' Well, Relic, or Lelic as we call it in moments like these, is known for not knowing how to balance. Despite that, CoH 3 is far. FAR better balanced than CoH 1, where the brits could blow you up with artillery that had range that felt map-wide or could gain 100% map vision with some commando shenanigans, not to mention Panzer Elite and their shenanigans, CoH 2, where the SU-85 could spot for itself, thus removing the only real weakness of tank destroyers or the amount of clown-car based shenanigans most factions have access too, soviet fire spam, soviet instant-retreat propaganda artillery, brit sim cities, us rifle, pathfinder and jackson spam, penal and conscript ptrs spam, the magical Tiger II and many, MANY more examples of insane, unbalanced, absurd shenanigans that can decide the game for you 10 minutes in, CoH 3 actually has more in-deapth design with the battlegroups, allowing some flexibility and adaptablity, giving you a chance to come back with some strategy or double down on your advantage rather than leaving you in the dust as doctrines did in 2. Here lethality is higher at a distance than in 2 making long-range firefights less of a slog, all AT options are more lethal, thus making armour rush less dangerous that it was in 2, meaning a single light tank gotten a bit too early won't win you the game even if it costs it it's life and a single mass rout won't cost you the bulk of your army when they drive into your base and start rolling over your units (crushing was removed unless done to pinned units, a great change balance-wise). Do I think Italian Combined Arms is essentially a useless doctrine? Yes. Were Gustatori handled the wrong way since launch? Also yes. Brit infantry sections could tackle any issue, jaegers could too, so on and so forth, but these issues were adressed and are no longer. The devs care, they fixed strafes and loiters, they tackle bugs and pathfinding is the best it has been in any CoH game and don't even get me started on the UI, it's leaps and bonds ahead of the other games! True, CoH is still bad at explaining it's mechanics, but as people who did CoH professionally have taught me (people like Felinewolfie), that has been an issue consistently in every CoH game. This one lacks the levels and quantity of OP BS that the other two did and while that may change as battlegroups and, hopefully, factions roll out, at least all is fine for now, by comparison anyway.
Exibit D): 'DLC policy bad.' Do you hounestly expect me to defend 2 battlegroups for 17 euro as a DLC? Fat chance, people have every right to diss it and it should never have happened, I am happy the 2 new battlegroups released with 1.6.0 are not classed as DLC. I hope they learn from that and the next DLC is a faction or 2 with their own unique single player content.
TL;DR: Game runs very well, bugs are few and far in-between now and the rest are being squashed, saying the game looks bad is purely subjective as an argument and no grounds to hate on this game alone, balance is better than it has ever been with quality of life additions, but the DLC policy and campagin still need work. Give the game a try, you won't regeret it!

Company of Heroes 3,"I Pre-ordered the premium edition version of this game after putting hundreds of hours into COH2, a game that i loved and enjoyed for years... From the fun and re-playable coop missions to the almost overwhelming choice of commander/battlegroups... then COH3 releases and i could not feel more disappointed at state of the game. Absolutely pathetic choice of battlegroups, ZERO coop missions and not a sign or trace of seeing those glorious coop missions that we as a fanbase got to experience in COH2 anytime soon...  SHAME ON YOU RELIC! 

After over 2 years of updates and bugfixes to make it somewhat enjoyable they release the FIRE AND STEEL DLC that is 32.49$ CAD..... all of these battlegroups should be added to the base game. Absolute MONEY-GRABBING game development tactics.                                                SHAME ON YOU RELIC!

The devs should compensate the players who bought the premium addition and spent 20$ on the absolute Dinosaur doo-doo pile called HAMMER AND SHIELD and give them DLC for free. 

This game should have been released in early access with a 29.99 price tag.. pathetic. Even with the sour taste of Relics failures in my mouth i still continue playing COH3 while the RELIC slowly works towards giving us what should have been a finished product 2 years ago.

                                                                                   SHAME ON YOU RELIC!",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"They listed my GPU as supported and then quietly patched out support back in the first year, well after the refund window had passed. Absolutely heinous rug pull from a heinous company. This hot garbage is just stuck in my steam library but just crashes and they intend to do nothing about it. Money genuinely stolen.",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"CoH3 is where it's at. I've been playing CoH since CoH1 on a physical disc and really got into the multiplayer with CoH2. CoH3 takes the best from CoH1 and CoH2, then adds a healthy amount of its own uniqueness and cooks it all up into a fantastic entry into the franchise. This review is based primarily on the multiplayer experience.

To be clear, CoH3 did not have a good launch. It was released too early. Everyone can agree with that. Now, however, the game is in a fantastic state. Here are some key points that makes CoH3 the best game in the franchise.

- Every faction is unique, but all are equally competitive (obviously the current state of the game with balance patches can affect this to some degree)

- Every Battlegroup for each faction is completely unique and each faction will soon have 5 different ones to choose from. CoH1 had this uniqueness, but only 3 to choose from for each faction. CoH2 had the same abilities present amongst various different commanders which made many commanders not wholly unique.

- Every faction has multiple viable builds. For example, you might see a USF generic Rifle build, or they might go heavy support center. From there you might see a single greyhound, or you might see a chaffee or two. Maybe the USF player relies on halftracks more instead and maybe even skips motor pool entirely. Each game just feels very different because so many different builds are viable. It's a nice breath of fresh air from the CoH2 repetition of build 3-4 inf squads then rush light vic into ATG into medium armor. In CoH3 you have some games where medium armor never hits the field and it's all light vehicles all game. Or there are no light vehicles and it's a straight rush to medium armor. You even see top level players sometimes spending fuel on healing before their first light vehicle. The viability of different builds is one of the primary reasons this game is better than CoH1 and 2. In CoH2 a USF player that builds 3 Stuarts in a game and never techs T4 is memeing. In CoH3, a USF player that builds a Greyhound into 3 Chaffees might actually be doing the best thing for themselves in their situation.

- Faction design is amazing. 
-- UKF is mostly your generic COH faction, but even they have fun choices to be made throughout the game. Do you go early Dingo? Double Engineer or Vickers? Or neither and go all Rifle Sections? Maybe get out some Aussie Squads? All early game choices that are all viable in different situations.
-- Wehr is somewhat similar to CoH2 Soviets, but still with great MGs. Here, opening builds still vary a lot. Some go double pio, some go kettenkrad. Then is it 3-4 Grens? or 2 grens and an MG? Sometimes you see double MG. Then do you go Luftwaffe or Panzergrenadier HQ for your T2 building? I absolutely love all of the choices again here and how they all fit into different situations and approaches to the game
-- USF seemed the most one-dimensional at first, until the power of the WSC was discovered. Now you see some straight WSC openers with only support weapons and scouts/engineers. Of course, you still see many generic Rifleman builds. You also see a lot of mixed builds now too with riflemen and maybe a bazooka squad or two. Then you might see some halftrack play, or you'll see some motor pool. Again, very fun choices to be amde.
-- Then there's DAK. For any COH1 vets out htere, DAK is if Panzer Elite was made the right way. They are very light vehicle and mechanized focused, but they are not broken. The variety in viable builds is probably greatest with DAK and is one of the most interesting factions to play for that reason imo. 

- The game is still receiving balance patches and DLC. 4 new Battlegroups are set to release this month. New maps are added once or twice a year. Balance is tweaked regularly, but not so often that you can't learn and adapt your builds.

If you're still on the other side of the fence about this, just auto-vault over and give it a try. The gameplay is fun and the decision making is so compelling that I can honestly never go back to the other games in the franchise. I truly believe Relic have hit their mark with this game and I cannot recommend it enough.",True,Strategy

Company of Heroes 3,"Game had a tough launch and deserved its criticism, but all of the glaring issues have been fixed. Very fun game that has moved the series forward in a way that makes the older games very difficult to go back and play. At this point, the game is well worth the money at full price. Sure, occasionally balance is out of whack and can be frustrating... but that is what you get with an RTS that is still putting out new content/units. Overall the game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend for all those interested in skirmish/multiplayer 

**Disclaimer: I completed both campaigns at launch and thought Italian was ""solid"" but way too repetitive, while the African campaign was ""meh"" because it was bare bones and pretty short.  I have not touched either campaign since completing them when game was released - no clue if the improvements have made the game worth the $$ for players that are primarily interested in single player campaigns.**",True,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"I still believe CoH2 is the superior choice currently, if you haven't tried/gotten used to the new QoLs in this game. These are all the currently main issues that affect me as a PVE only player.

1. AI sucks, they're really easy to predict and usually only have a single build order. For example, they have a fixed rule of ""if vehicle is less than 20% hp, retreat to base regardless of situation"" and since the AI can see through FOW, units sometimes cower in cover before you see them, tanks run to the edges of the map.
2. Modding has been severely limited in this game intentionally, leading to some mod devs to even choose to stay with CoH2.
3. Worse atmosphere and audio, the lighting just seems off, voicelines are not memorable and some are recycled between units. We had faction specific main menu music, battle and victory themes in CoH2, it's the same every faction every game in CoH3.
4. The new dlc, they are charging us half the price of the base game. Personally, even if this was a F2P game, locking more than half of the heavy tanks behind a dlc feels scummy. (DLC contains Pershing, Elefant, King Tiger and Churchill Crocodile. Base contains Churchill, it's variant Black Prince and Tiger.)
5. The new CoH3 merit system. Complete challenges and supposedly earn battlegroups (the DLCs) and skins with the in game merit currency system. This was changed recently, battlegroups are now not earnable, the skin shop is just sad with very limited choices. Hundreds of hours spent on the merit challenges just to have the main reward silently taken away, mentioned only in one update post.

Most of my time spent in CoH3 was earning merit challenges in boring games whereas in CoH2 I played for fun. At least for VS Ai players, I highly recommend staying with/getting CoH2 with mods. I cannot recommend enough All Units (170 added) mod by SneakEye and avoiding CoH3 for now.",False,Strategy
Company of Heroes 3,"Still clunky, feels both slow as molasses and too fast at the same time somehow (troops move slowly, ranges feel basically point-blank, but the damage output forces you to constantly retreat, meaning you can't actually hold a line).

If you like to sweat in your RTS and not actually build up anything or have time to actually learn the intricacies of your battlegroups, then sure have fun blobbing in it.

Company of Heroes 3,"I've been a fan of coh & relic since the release of coh2.
Relic have made considerable improvements in coh3, Love the game-play, audio and graphics but the main attraction, the multiplayer is just in a constant terrible state and I just can't recommend the game because of it.

There are two areas that just ruins multiplayer:
[olist]
[*] The cheats. Since the start of 2025, the number of exploits and cheats like fov expansion and fog of war removal has grown staggeringly. I come across this in every 2-3 matches and it's just a nuisance to play against. Artillery/Mortar on hidden units, nullifies your flanks, and then exploits your openings.
Relic do have reporting system and claim to take action since the release of the fire & steel, but it's not the case, in fact, there is more cheats now than ever.  It is just not fun to play against. 

I don't like to throw accusations of cheats out there, but relics replay system and pov of the suspect makes it very easy to verify this, some don't even try to hid it in the first place... There have been numerous reddit posts about this and it's just so easy to cheat in this game it's wild. I will say cheats is THE biggest problem/hindrance for coh3 multiplayer 

[*]The unit exploits. It is no surprise to bring up blobbing in this franchise... but it is just sad in coh3. What's the point of diversifying units when you can just build 8 main line infantry, mgs, or any other of the same unit and throw them out all at once? I see it mainly with USF and riflemen (or rangers), Brits and crusaders, Werhm and mgs, Dakand Bersa. In low and high elo games there is no sense of strategy, just keep throwing a large volume of the same unit and you will have success.

At least in coh2 there were better counters to this, but Relic just can not find a way to balance this in coh3 despite them acknowledging the issue but making no real effort to solve it... It is a boring play style to play as or against in this game.
[/olist]

In the end, I've always liked Relic as a studio, I do understand their constraints now being an independent studio and they do try to improve the game... but in the wrong way.

COH3 has a lot of potential despite its immature release, it took a long time to get at where it is now but honestly props to the Dev's and staff of Relic as they had to earn there respect as an effective fun RTS Game Company.

So I waited until last year when it was 50 percent off, and since then I can't complain at all. I currently have almost 200 hours on record and will have dozens more after this update.

If you have over 50, 100 hours you clearly like the game. For comparison, I can expect to spend 10 dollars for a fast-food meal, so 60/30 dollars for a game or 20ish for a DLC is well worth the money. With my current hours and current invest into the game averages out to 0.75 cents and hour. How much value are people really going to cry about? They also gave 
 free content back then which was a great apology and discounted another DLC which was kinda lackluster albeit. 

All in all a great game that I'll gladly support. RTS is not dead yet, but if we don't continue to support the Devs that constantly work on creating more content and updating their games, then we are destroying our own community.  We can't except them to constantly work for free. 

There are so many games that are released, review bombed and subsequently dropped and abandoned. OR we complain that releases aren't pushed fast enough, or updates and DLC aren't made quick enough, well we can't have our cake and eat it too.

[b]1. Loading screen name/team bug: [/b] So far I haven't seen this bug again. So perhaps it has been fixed

[b]2. Early and Mid game balance issue: [/b] with the new 2.0 update, the meta certainly changes. I haven't played much to know for sure which spam got buffed and which got nerfed. So far I only found new USF half-track spam since they got cheaper (or maybe I have been playing on low ELO for too much I rarely find this spam)

[b]3. Replay watch sync-error issue: [/b] Issue addressed I think? Haven't found any replay errors yet.

[b]4. Auto-match balance issue: [/b] I might be biased but I think it's been fixed as well. Tho someone certainly need to make tutorial to teach the Axis newbies how to deal with early Allies light tank/armored car rush coz I see them getting their ass handed immediately once it happens.

[b]5. Can't buy the 4th battlegroup of wehrmacht and USF factions in-game with merits without the corresponding DLC: [/b] The in-game UI has been fixed. It now tells you to buy the DLC to buy the battlegroup. Just like the new fire & steel battlegroups.

[b]6. Rapido River Crossing bugs: [/b] I still haven't tried this map again. It used to have a lot of bugs that can happen in this map so I always have it downvoted. examples are: breach cannot finish so unit gets stuck doing nothing, AT gun crews out of action but the AT gun itself still capable of moving around and attack with 0 HP.

Company of Heroes 3,"The issue to why over 1k more players are on CoH2 vs CoH3 is rather easy to explain.

Just look at how they setup the community spaces, discord, etc.
There is no substance for an easy access community.
Online multiplayer setup is basic and doesn't build interactions, should have in-game voice by now, it would significantly help strategy, but... instead of focusing on multiplayer and community......
John and his team gutted the game and went with single player campaign and cut-scenes that wasted all the money, time and talent.
You know, instead of building on top of, what was already a great game.
THEY FOCUSED ON THE WRONG THINGS.

 CoH3 went hard left field to be ""Different"" and failed.

They could have taken CoH2 + graphic touch ups, same audio, and added some B/s factions just for flavor, maybe even introduced sea/air units......  transport troops across the sea or something, naval battles for extra supply/fuel, like legit there is a Ton to work with.

Instead, they limit the players ability to manipulate/customize their army, and pretty much killed the game. These no substance update/battlegroups are NOT the answer.
We could have 20 battlegroups each faction just by allowing the community to make them, then absorb and test/edit/implement. Common sense tho.

Read any forum or comment section and a monkey could have picked all this up way long ago.... like prior/during development. Now here we are, no active players, no community, game is over priced. But the cartoony cut scenes, oooooh weee soooo coool.

Company of Heroes 3,"I purchased this game for the Christmas holidays last year. COH was one of my favorite franchises and I figured that there had been sufficient time since launch for the bugs of the game to get ironed out. Also, I really enjoy playing the campaign of the game, even if the story can be uneven at times. So, I was looking forward to spending some time on this game...

...I wish I had returned it.

The campaign is dull, uninspired and a bug-filled mess. I finished the DAK campaign and it was a total bore, with not a lot of interesting things or scenarios to play out. The story was abysmal and the characters feel like caricature of historical figures/peoples. 

The Italian Campaign was worse story-wise, but at least I thought that the skirmish-type gameplay and random scenarios were at least somewhat less monotonous. I was even starting to enjoy the game slightly - but then I ran into a bug where a city would continuously get attacked and defended, but even if I win the battle the city would remain in enemy hands. The balance is also extremely wonky - some maps are pushovers, some are deathmarches that have you lose even if you micro well as the AI seems like it never loses resources nor men to throw at you.

Extremely disappointing - unless you really wanna play multiplayer, dont buy this game. Even then - COH2 is a much more polished product + cheap as chips nowadays.

A disappointing sequel to a disappointing sequel. 
Coh2 was inferior to the first game, but still a pretty alright game that was worth playing. Coh3 is just mid. It feels like a low effort sequel that just copies Coh2 with less content. Supposedly there were a tone of bugs and balance issues, but I wasn't around for that and there has been patching. I haven't delved into the multiplayer so let's see what it has to offer for SP content.
Well it contains 2 different campaigns. The dynamic Italy campaign similar to the ardens DLC for coh2, and a more traditional North Africa Campaign for the Axis. This is the better of the two. My only issues are the fact that its short, and the story focuses on some family of african partisans that is rather detached from the main missions. 

As for the Italy campaign (which is the main focus) is where the game is a mess. While they did expand it from the ardens DLC, changing it to have more of a grand strategy feel, oh boy is it not good. For starters the difficulty curve is all over the place. Starting it can be the hardest part because of how little resources you have to work with, and it soon becomes obvious the enemy doesn't play by the rules. Later on it gets real repetative because to capture territory you have to play out a battle. The major territories have proper missions, and most of these are fine. The problem is the other occupied zones you have to play repetitive multiplayer style skirmishes... If I wanted to play those I would play multiplayer. And what's worse, there is no option for auto resolve like say.. total war. It get's real old. The breaking point for me is when I won one of these and the game didn't register the capture. After that I just rushed for the endgame. Yeah it's not good.
I didn't bother with the dlc as it looked like a rip off. Oh, and the story is goes out of its way (with awful low budget cut scenes I might add) to continue to inject women into WW2. Like, we get it. there were some women in certain partisan groups and the soviet army, but not to the point to that these games that are desperate to re wright history try to portray. Though its not as in your face about it as Vanguard and Battlefield V were. Stop trying to inject fake diversity into WW1 and 2

The online part of the game has become more challenging than the previous two versions and unlike Coh2, in Coh3 your smallest mistakes can be irreparable and end in defeat.

I like this difficulty in the online part of the game, but I feel that it makes new players frustrated. To put it more briefly, the online part of the game is not suitable for new players and if a player is not willing to endure repeated failures and humiliation to learn, he will probably give up the game very soon.

Counter-Strike 2,"Unfortunately, it is truly a great game ruined by cheaters.

I had a very long break from CS (and gaming in general), so I was pretty excited to get back and enjoy the gameplay. That happened to be impossible as in at least 20% of your games you'll match up against someone cheating.
Back in 2014-2017 you would also occasionally meet someone cheating, but usually on higher ranks such as LE, LEM, SMFC, GE, that's why (I think) they cheated in the first place — to get to higher ranks and stay there.

Downloading CS years later (and having 0 skill left) I was surprised to find out that now you have silvers and novas flooded with cheaters, which makes 0 sense to me — What is those guys' goal? Why are they ranked so low using cheats? So, in 2025 cheating is not something you occasionally find among high-ranks competing between each other, but rather an issue you simply cannot avoid. Among other things, this makes the game very unfriendly for newbies who expect to play against someone in their skill bracket.

Someone might say ""you are just bad and that's why you think others cheat"" and while I get this POV, it is simply not the case. I might not be good anymore but I certainly remember the game's physics and stuff like that. It's quite easy to detect a cheater when you played the game for the first time in 2003. (Also, a 0 level, 1 year old, 50 hours in game Steam account having 80% HS% is simply something very, very suspicious).

Also someone might say ""just don't play on Valve's servers, go to FACEIT"". Firstly, I just want to casully play the game for an hour to relax, not to be all 'competitive' and ruin other's desire to win. Secondly, why can't the game be playable ""out of the box"" with no need to have any kind of 'add-ons'?

Ah, Counter-Strike 2. The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—a game we all spent years complaining about.

First, let's talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what it’s like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2’s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like you're guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galore—it’s like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.

Then, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piece—nice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesn’t work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. It's almost impressive.

But don’t worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokes—because that’s what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.

Meanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesn’t make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.

Counter-Strike 2,"Performance and Optimization Nightmare ""our cs2 experience""
When Counter-Strike 2 was first teased, there were high hopes. The game was supposed to be more ""next-gen,"" with improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and advanced technology that should’ve pushed the franchise into the future. Unfortunately, what we got instead feels like a rushed, undercooked product. Even with a top-tier gaming PC—one that comfortably runs CS:GO at high frame rates—I’m seeing Counter-Strike 2 stutter and lag. It’s as if the game is trying to push something it’s not ready for. FPS drops occur regularly, and the frame rates plummet during high-intensity moments, something that simply wasn’t an issue in its predecessor. The optimization is absolutely terrible.

To make matters worse, there’s an issue with how the game allocates resources. I’ve seen instances where my GPU usage is well below 60%, and my CPU spikes, all while the game stutters to keep up. The result? A frustrating, broken experience where you’re constantly fighting against the game's inherent performance flaws. That might be something you can tolerate in an early beta, but this is the full release, and it's completely inexcusable. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got an RTX 3090 or the latest Intel chip, the game will make you feel like you’re playing on an ancient machine.

Inconsistent Hit Registration and Broken Mechanics
Counter-Strike has always been about precision and skill. A large part of its charm comes from that skill-based combat, where landing shots is directly tied to your aim and timing. But with Counter-Strike 2, the game has broken that core principle.

The so-called “sub-tick” system is a mess. For those who aren’t familiar, this was introduced as a way to improve server tick rates and reduce lag-related issues. Instead of improving things, it has made hit registration feel wildly inconsistent. I’ll be facing an enemy at close range, unload an entire magazine, only to see my shots whiff completely. There’s a delay between the time I pull the trigger and when the shots actually register, and this isn’t just occasional—it’s constant.

You’ll find yourself dying around corners where you’re certain you had the angle, or getting one-tapped by enemies whose bullets seem to bend through walls. It’s not just frustrating, it’s completely maddening. The fundamental mechanics that once made the series great are in shambles. What’s the point of precision aiming when the game itself can’t get the basics right?

Cheating Epidemic: A Competitive Nightmare
One of the most frustrating things about Counter-Strike 2 is the fact that Valve has somehow failed to address the cheating problem in any meaningful way. Aimbots, wallhacks, speed hacks, you name it—cheaters are running rampant in this game, and there’s no real effort to stem the tide.

I’ve spent more time in matches recently reporting players than actually enjoying the game. And even when you do report someone, there’s no guarantee anything will be done about it. Valve’s anti-cheat system feels like a joke, especially when you encounter blatant cheaters who have no fear of being caught. It’s ruining the game’s competitive integrity. What’s the point of trying to be good at a game when your opponents can essentially toggle on god-mode cheats and you’re left helpless?

It’s so bad that I’ve been in matches where cheaters completely dominate, and no one can do anything about it. It destroys the fun of playing competitively. It’s all the more upsetting because Counter-Strike used to be a title where competitive fairness was sacred. Now, it feels like a free-for-all, where cheating is normalized and punished rarely—if at all.

Content Removal: The Soul of Counter-Strike is Gone
One of the biggest slaps in the face to longtime fans is the removal of classic content and game modes. Gone are the beloved modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone, which added variety and fun to the game when you wanted a break from competitive matches. These modes helped flesh out CS:GO, offering something different when the typical 5v5 match just didn’t cut it. Now, with Counter-Strike 2, those modes are mysteriously absent, leaving a void that no amount of new skins or maps can fill.

On top of that, the removal of support for macOS was a baffling decision. Many players in the community, including myself, used to play on Macs, and this sudden exclusion has left a large portion of the fanbase unable to even play the game. For a game that has prided itself on being accessible, this is a huge step back.

Lack of Communication and Developer Inaction
Valve's silence is deafening. The community has voiced its concerns repeatedly, yet the developers have remained almost entirely mute. No clear updates, no explanations for why the game is in the state it’s in—just radio silence. Players are being left in the dark, wondering whether Valve even cares about fixing the game or if they’re just going to move on to the next big title.

This lack of communication has only fueled the anger within the community. We’ve seen them take months to address even the most basic issues, and the fear that Counter-Strike 2 will continue to be neglected is growing every day. The franchise has always had a strong relationship with its fanbase, but that’s rapidly eroding as Valve continues to push out half-baked updates and ignores player feedback.

The State of the Community
Perhaps one of the most disheartening aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is the state of its community. The game has become a toxic wasteland, with constant cheating, connection issues, and poor matchmaking experiences. The player base is frustrated and demoralized, and it shows in how people behave during matches. Once, the competitive nature of CS brought out the best in players, creating an environment of skill and camaraderie. Now, it’s all about getting through the match without tearing your hair out.

The introduction of the new matchmaking system has only made things worse. The rankings feel inconsistent, and there are so many smurf accounts—players intentionally playing at lower levels to dominate newbies—that it’s impossible to climb without running into wall after wall. It’s made the competitive scene feel pointless, with no real progression.

In Conclusion: A Franchise in Decline
After hundreds, maybe thousands of hours spent in the Counter-Strike series, I never thought I’d be here, completely disillusioned and frustrated with the state of the game. Counter-Strike 2 has taken everything that made the franchise great and run it into the ground. What was supposed to be a promising evolution of the series has instead resulted in an unoptimized, broken, and increasingly unpopular title.

It’s hard to recommend the game to anyone anymore. I still have hope that Valve will turn things around, but with each passing update, it feels more like they’re ignoring the core issues that the community is pleading for them to address. Until that happens, Counter-Strike 2 remains an absolute disaster of a release—unplayable, unbalanced, and unrecognizable as the game we all loved.",False,Strategy
Counter-Strike 2,"Counter-Strike has ruined many relationships and people in general. From crippling gambling addictions, to pure rage from getting destroyed, taking away maps and or tweaking game play, playing cheaters all the time, the list goes on. So people just lost their gosh darn minds.

Counter-Strike 2,"[h1]Honest CS2 Review from a player with a combined 10 years of CS experience, across all games. Yes, even Nexon.[/h1]

CS2 is.... so god damn bittersweet to play. The graphics and particles, are amazing. Truly something I would've only dreamed of when I was an 11 year old boy and played CS:GO for the first time. The skins look better than ever with this new revamped lighting, and it's easier than ever to get into the game.

[h2]The new and ""improved"" ranking system[/h2] 

To call this system improved is... a half truth. Yes, it's more specific to maps, but also makes it EXTREMELY difficult to truly keep track of your skill level, unless you exclusively play premier. This also kinda segues into my issue with the SBMM in normal competitive mode, as if ONE person on your team is Gold Nova on that map, and the rest of you are unranked or Silver 1, the odds of the enemy team having multiple players matching your most powerful player's skill level is very high. 

[h2]The bugs. Dear Christ, the bugs.[/h2]

Where in the name of Christ do I start? For every bug fixed from CS:GO, 2 more appear in this game. Sure, most of them get patched quickly, but the ones that stay are absolutely foul. It's not uncommon for your game to get stuck in the ""CT Side"" or ""T Side"" opening cutscene, rendering you useless until you rejoin the match. 

WHICH, leads me to the next point. Sometimes, (more often than not) should you have to rejoin a competitive or premier match, clicking ""reconnect"" has a very high chance of registering your click, starting the loading timer, but not loading you in. It will seriously sit there and count for the entirety of your re-join timer, at which point it will give you an abandonment cooldown. This can only be fixed by restarting your entire game and trying to connect again, BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT, or very quickly cancelling the load by leaving the party, and clicking ""reconnect"" again.

 [h2]Bots. All the bots. More robots than an unmanned assembly line up in here.[/h2] 

Whether you join a casual match and find a bot-farm match, kicking you almost immediately, or you have someone on your comp queue that has an autoclicker simply to avoid an idling kick so they can farm XP, there is no shortage of bots in this game unless you're full-stacked in a competitive gamemode, or you avoid Deathmatch, Casual, and Arms Race altogether outside of private matches. Admittedly, this problem has lessened in the past couple months. 

 [h3]Summary[/h3]

Despite my harsh words about the game, I think most of it's downfalls can be attributed to it's somewhat rushed release. If this game wasn't damn near Cyberpunk level rushed, I doubt I'd have much to talk about here. All in all, it's still the same old CS you know and love if you're looking for a competitive FPS game to kill time with some friends and hear users from around the world call you slurs you've never even heard of.

Counter-Strike 2,"tl;dr: Great game, good community, bad cheaters

Counter-Strike 2 is a great game and, in my opinion, a worthy successor to CS:GO—despite the somewhat strange shooting mechanics. Since the introduction of Subtick, every one-tap feels amazing, but spraying feels incredibly random, which is further amplified by the damage prediction system.

I’ve personally tested the new damage prediction for over 200 hours, and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it feels more responsive; on the other, about a third of the shots result in fake dinks or fake hits. This is especially frustrating when spraying: you see a fake dink, stop shooting because you think you’ve hit the enemy properly, and then end up dying because of it.

That covers the “CS2 vs. CS:GO update” part.

Now, onto the really good aspects: CS2 is an excellent example of a well-designed 5v5 competitive FPS. The core gameplay feels great, and the movement is some of the best I’ve ever seen in an FPS. Meeting new people, playing casual game modes with friends—or even alone—can be really fun! Improving your skills, seeing your progress, and facing increasingly difficult opponents is a rewarding experience.

CS2 perfectly embodies the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master.” Even the best players in the world still have room to improve!

Now, another downside: cheaters. First of all, the situation has improved. But at the same time, it still doesn’t feel truly fixed. Some players are blatantly rage cheating yet remain unbanned. I’ve watched multiple Wingman demos where opponents are locking onto my head—even through walls and smokes—bunny-hopping flawlessly across the map, and wallbanging my teammate and me like crazy. And yet, they’re still not banned. Ridiculous. All we can do is wait for Overwatch to be rolled out to more players.

I could probably go on forever, but I’ll wrap it up here.

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]PUBG – The Battle Royale That Started It All[/h1]

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★

PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

Survival & Tension: ★★★★★

Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆

While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.

Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆

KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.

Overall Verdict:

PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters.",True,Strategy

The original Battle Royale. PUBG's name will be echoed for generations as a cultural milestone that paved the way for all future BR's released to this day. What a wonderful game this was during its prime, little to no flaws in terms of performance and game mechanics. Every match is as stressful as it is rewarding. Unfortunately it just barely misses the perfect score for a few reasons. PUBG's downfall is one that should be studied by all future game developers. The reason for this downfall being BR's such as Fortnite and Apex at their peaks respectively. This wasn't because of quality or accessibility (Even though PUBG is notorious for poor performance on console.) but rather its price. PUBG did everything right, aside from removing that price tag sooner. The pride PUBG held for its lovechild was ultimately its downfall, with so many other free options, why convince friends to spend the thirty dollars on PUBG?

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Grand Theft Auto V – Great Game, But Not Without Issues

GTA V offers an amazing single-player experience with a well-written story, fun missions, and a detailed open world. The gameplay is smooth, and Los Santos feels alive with plenty to do.

GTA Online has tons of content, but it's heavily grindy, filled with toxic players using Oppressor Mk IIs, and plagued with cheaters and modders, especially on PC. Bugs and connection issues are still common, and loading times remain frustratingly long. Rockstar’s focus on microtransactions also hurts the experience.

The single-player is worth it, but GTA Online can be frustrating unless you play with friends.",True,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Offline/solo content is 10/10, very fun, very well made. 
Online co-op should have a separate achievement list --- it is a complete mess, endless waiting in loading screens, and too many failed missions because the team quits. No back fill or bots, no distribution of money when crewmates leave heists. 
I guess with friends it would be tolerable, but the solo-with-randoms experience is miserable.",True,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Fuck you for removing compatibility so many years after release without reason, cheaters still cheat and regular players can't play anymore. Return the Deck and Linux compatibility and remove the malware from the game.",False,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"The game introduced kernel level anti-cheat with the 1.69 update, which is fine but the company is LYING about Steam Deck/Linux not supporting BattlEye, as Valve has already worked with BattlEye and EAC to provide support for Linux on these anticheats, the company also lied about the games never being officially supported on the Steam Deck/Linux as the verified badge was on the game before the BattlEye update and the company never claimed the badge wasn't official, the AC was also bypassed within days by an open source program that Rockstar illegally took down, but the dev wasn't willing to fight back, this company is a lying piece of shit, that only cares about profits, not players, their only objective is to milk this game's shitty online and screw over anyone who even dares to not play by their rules, even Expanded & Enhanced took 3 unecessary years to be released on PC simply because they couldn't resell the game to PC players like they could to console players because we aren't fucking stupid.",False,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"I must give it negative review since GTA Online has become unplayable on Linux cause of anticheat. I know this game was not made for Linux in the first place, but since it worked in Linux for all this time, I invested time in GTA Online only to be kick out by anticheat.

GTA singleplayer is still playable, but I doubt I would be replaying sp in the future. SP story is fun, critical of current day US, a bit of a snapshot of current life over there.

GTA online is a bit too grindy for my taste, but I guess they have to make you want to buy those sharkcards. Interesting thing is that in online, ingame characters call you to advertise sharkcards or other things that they think could bring more money. At first it's fun, until you realise they will do these calls every time you enter the game. That is no fun, and is tiring. You will answer the call even if you do not want to. And if you stop the call, you will cause them to call you even more.
I like recently added taxi missions in online. I do not like that you can not fix your taxi car as mission goes on. Also you can not modify that car in any way. There is some black and red version that you can pay a lot of $ or win it in the arena. At the moment, you can only $ (in game c), as arena is basically dead, nobody plays it. I do not know what mods can you make to that car, I tried to get it just so I could modify it.",False,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Ever since I was a kid, GTA V has been more than just a game to me. It’s a part of my gaming soul. From the first time I set foot in Los Santos, I was completely hooked. The massive open world, the freedom to do whatever I wanted, and the unforgettable story made it an experience like no other.  
Even after all these years, my love for GTA V hasn’t faded. Whether I’m causing chaos in the city, racing through the streets, or just messing around with friends in GTA Online, the game never stops being fun. The memories I’ve made such as: Epic heists, Hilarious fails, and ""Insane stunts"" :D are moments I’ll never forget.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"After all this time bro :(
One of my favourite games of all time, as a Linux user I can no longer play is because after 10 years they have decided to downgrade to a kernel-level anticheat which blocks Linux by design. Making it, inverse from the past, one of actually very few games these days that doesn't run on Linux.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,the game is stressful. Game is full of bugs and its been out for way too many years. keeping adding garbage but dont fix the 1000s of bugs. still full of hackers....,False,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Story and Characters:
While the three protagonists are interesting, the overall story feels disjointed and lacks the emotional depth of previous GTA titles like GTA IV. The satire and humor, while entertaining, can feel over-the-top and repetitive, making it hard to connect with the narrative.

Mission Design:
Many missions follow a similar formula: drive somewhere, shoot enemies, and escape. While there are standout heist missions, a lot of the gameplay can feel repetitive, especially for players who aren’t fans of open-world fetch quests.

Controls and Mechanics:
The controls, particularly for shooting and driving, can feel clunky and outdated compared to more modern games. The cover system is serviceable but not as smooth as in dedicated shooters.

Conclusion:
Grand Theft Auto V is a well-crafted game with a lot to offer, but it might not live up to the hype for everyone. Its open world and production values are impressive, but the repetitive mission design, lack of innovation, and shallow story can make it feel like an average experience. For players seeking a deep, narrative-driven game or groundbreaking gameplay, GTA V might fall short. However, for those who enjoy sandbox-style chaos and multiplayer shenanigans, it’s still a solid choice.

If you want to have a good time in Online GTAV, you are in for a disappointment.

In my honest opinion, if you want to do missions on Online GTAV, do them in a private session, if you want to deal with a solo mission. Otherwise, have fun and download GTAV and play happily, don't be influenced by the modders (EVEN THO IS 2025 AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS AT GTAV)",True,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Story and Characters: Three dudes – a grumpy old geezer, a total psycho biker dude, and a young hustler – pull off bank jobs and cause absolute mayhem.  Think Ocean's Eleven but way more bonkers. The plot's a rollercoaster, the characters are off-the-wall nuts, and the lines are funnier than a barrel of monkeys.
 
Gameplay and Open World: Los Santos is a giant playground – steal cars, mess with NPCs, and do stuff so ridiculous it's genius. Golfing? Yoga?  Yeah, why not?  Just remember to cause some serious ruckus.
 
Online Mode (GTA Online): Wanna be in a crazy car chase with 29 other lunatics? GTA Online's your jam. It's total chaos; anything goes (and usually does).  Expect epic battles, hilarious glitches, and maybe a few salty rage quits.  Unless you're rocking some serious mods, other players might try to school you.  It's a total free-for-all, so be prepared to get your butt kicked (and dish it out too!).  However, big downside:  you can't play online through Steam Deck because of that pesky anti-cheat.  Bummer, right?
 
Graphics and Sound: The graphics are still killer, even after all these years. Los Santos looks so real you'll forget you're not actually causing trouble IRL. The soundtrack is fire – the perfect tunes for all the crazy action.
 
Overall: GTA V is the bomb.com. It's hilarious and surprisingly deep, a chaotic adventure that'll keep you glued to your screen.  It would be a solid 9/10, but that Steam Deck online issue and the anti-cheat shenanigans knock it down to an 8/10. Still a must-play, though!  Seriously, go get it.",True,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,Too much grinding. Its been out for such a long time and the PC edition still doesnt have all the features that the console edition has.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,Unacceptable to add kernel level anti cheat after 9 years. When I bought the game kernel level anti cheat wasn’t part of the agreement or I wouldn’t have purchased it. I don’t purchase games that include kernel level anti cheat. I don’t care about online functionality and only play single player and now I can’t without installing battleye which requires manual uninstallation and isn’t removed with the game. I won’t be able to play anymore as I don’t want anti cheat trash on my system. No steam deck support or Linux support anymore. Single player was good. Multiplayer was always a boring grindfest full of hackers and micro transactions and somehow they’ve made that worse by adding this rootkit. Kernel level anti cheat is worse than the cheaters. It’s up to Rockstar to solve the problem of cheating on their servers without forcing invasive spyware on end users machines.,False,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Great game for the casual player. If you want to learn to start shoot/aiming this is the game for you. or of you like crime in general. Though this isn't for sensitive players, as it may not contain Gore, it does have sex scenes and lots of Blood. Story mode is great, it has amazing lore. my favorite part about this game is the modding community. though same cant be said for the GTA V community, if your Soft don't bother entering Online.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5), developed by Rockstar Games, is an open-world action-adventure game that has remained one of the most popular and successful titles since its release in 2013. With a vast, detailed world, engaging story, and endless activities, GTA 5 continues to offer an unmatched sandbox experience.

Positive Aspects:
✅ Massive Open World – The fictional city of Los Santos is full of life, with incredible attention to detail, diverse environments, and endless opportunities for exploration.

✅ Engaging Story and Characters – The single-player campaign follows three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with unique personalities and missions, creating an engaging and cinematic experience.

✅ GTA Online Offers Endless Fun – The online multiplayer mode allows players to participate in heists, races, businesses, and more, constantly evolving with updates and new content.

✅ Variety of Gameplay Activities – Whether it’s robbing a bank, flying a jet, racing cars, or simply causing chaos, GTA 5 offers limitless freedom and activities.

✅ Modding Community (PC Version) – The game’s active modding community enhances gameplay with custom content, from realistic graphics to entirely new game modes.

Negative Aspects:
❌ GTA Online's Grind and Microtransactions – While fun, GTA Online can feel heavily monetized, pushing players toward purchasing Shark Cards to skip the long grind for in-game currency.

❌ Aging Graphics (Despite Updates) – While the game still looks good, especially with next-gen enhancements, some aspects of the visuals and animations feel dated compared to newer open-world games.

❌ Repetitive AI and Mission Structure – Some missions follow a predictable formula, and AI behavior can feel unrealistic at times, especially in police chases.

Final Verdict:
GTA 5 is one of the best open-world games ever made, offering a rich single-player experience and a constantly evolving online world. Despite some aging elements and monetization issues in GTA Online, the sheer amount of content and freedom make it a must-play for any gaming fan. 🚗💥🏙️",True,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"In short,
Story mode: 
The story itself is amazing. The characters were played amazingly. The side missions are interesting. The development of the character throughout the story is logical compelling, and you really want to know what actually happened at the beginning of the story (no spoilers).
The map is not small, but most of the action is happening only in the city (same goes for online). Something I'm sure has already been considered in GTA 6, seeing what has already been leaked.
Online:
A lot of people complain about the online version of the game for different reasons. But most of the complaints can have a workaround, while others... not so much.
For those who say there are moders and hackers, I've played the game mostly in an invite only session. Which means that I had no other player in the lobby. And I only join a public lobby to get the ""High demand bonus"" and the excitement.
Other say it's too much of a grind and is pay to win. I con only assume that these players are beginners and don't really understand all the content included in the game, with all the DLCs. Although, being a person who is playing ONLY for the fun, not for the meaningless grind, I have to say that without the Kosatka, I would have definitely not have even considered playing online that much, or even buying it twice after I lost my first account. So I'm happy i didn't play when the game didn't have these beasts of money making.

Rust,"🌟 2/10 – A Game for Psychopaths

I went into Rust expecting a challenging survival experience. What I got instead was a mental asylum in video game form. The biggest issue? The players. They are completely insane.

You spawn in as a fresh newbie, completely naked, and before you can even pick up a rock, some lunatic wearing a full metal suit will beat you to death for no reason. Try to build a base? Good luck! The moment you log off, some bored psychopaths will raid everything you own just because they can. There is no logic, no mercy—just pure, chaotic madness.

Survival games should be tough, but Rust isn’t about skill or strategy. It’s about who can be the biggest menace to society. Unless you enjoy being tortured by toxic players 24/7, stay far, far away.",False,Strategy
Rust,"The game fosters a fair and enjoyable experience with no toxicity or cheating. Players can relax and sleep well knowing their bases are protected from offline raids, allowing for a balanced and stress-free environment. With a welcoming community, the game ensures a positive experience that won’t disrupt your day.",True,Strategy

Rust,"It's a highly addictive, self disrespecting, brutal FPS ""survival"" game. Built upon the premise that sooner or later your going to loose everything you put into it.

AND THEN

You do it again!",True,Strategy
Rust,This game is a piece of shit...regardless of the unique and fun updates. I regularly play this game so much until I start seeing things that aren't there... This game is terrible and i genuinely despise playing it. Yet in it's simplicity I find it enjoyable to ruin someone else's day through sheer determination and hatred for humans.,False,Strategy
Rust,"Rating: 1/10

Rust, while having gained a huge following over the years, is one of those games that fails to live up to its potential. The premise is simple: a survival game where players must gather resources, build bases, and survive against each other and the environment. However, despite its popularity, Rust offers a frustrating and often unbalanced experience, leading to countless hours of wasted time and unnecessary rage. Here’s why it’s barely worth playing.

Why Rust Falls Short
💥 Unbalanced Progression System
Rust’s progression system is deeply flawed. The game requires extensive grinding to gather resources, craft items, and build structures. However, all of this work can be undone in a matter of minutes by a group of players raiding your base, stealing all your hard-earned materials. This creates a sense of futility that makes the game feel more like a chore than a rewarding experience. Rather than feeling accomplished, players often feel punished for their time spent grinding.

👾 Toxic Community and Harassment
While not unique to Rust, the toxic community is a major issue. The game has a notorious reputation for players griefing and harassing newcomers. Instead of focusing on the survival elements, many players opt for destructive behavior, such as raiding weaker players repeatedly, using offensive language, or ruining the experience for others. This makes it hard to enjoy the game, especially for those just starting out.

💻 Bugs and Glitches
Rust is known for its technical issues that negatively affect gameplay. Server lag, desync, and game-breaking bugs are a frequent occurrence. These issues hinder the experience, making what should be an enjoyable time into a frustrating mess. The lack of a consistent fix for these bugs makes the technical side of the game feel unpolished.

⚔️ Unpredictable PvP
Rust prides itself on PvP combat, but often the system feels unfair. Players who dedicate hours to crafting powerful weapons and building complex bases can be wiped out in an instant by a group of raiders, leading to moments of utter frustration. The reliance on PvP for progression can make the game feel like it’s more about luck than actual skill, especially if you're unlucky enough to be caught by a more advanced group.

Conclusion
While Rust has a solid foundation with its survival mechanics, it’s ultimately an experience that frustrates more than it entertains. The time spent grinding for resources can be quickly undone, the community can be toxic, and the technical issues are hard to ignore. While some players may enjoy the chaos and unpredictability of the game, Rust ultimately fails to deliver a fun, balanced, or rewarding experience for many. 1/10—it’s hard to recommend a game that leaves you feeling more annoyed than satisfied.",False,Strategy
Rust,I really enjoy playing this game. It has a lot of different options to explore with to keep you on edge. Very fun and addicting game. Good job Facepunch :),True,Strategy
Rust,"The most dedicated developers to a game I have ever seen. Monthly updates  that constantly are improving quality of life and adding new content. 

Rust also has a very stable player base even with the age of this game. The only sad part is like all shooters / looter survival games- there are cheaters, BUT it does depend on the servers you go to. You will meet life long friends and enemies on this game, and there are endless ways to play in just the vanilla game, let alone on modded/community servers.. Whether you want to be a passive farmer / trader, or an agressive pvper/raider or any level between... 

You can play alone quick on fast paced server and be satisfied for the night, or you can team up with buddies and spend an entire month dedicated to one survival experience against others. Or visa versa! There's just enough level of details to each bit of the game to where there's plenty of content, without it being overwhelming or confusing. There's not a huge learning curve when it comes to the combat either because they've given a lot of options to what you can use and how you can use it, and I believe there's something here in this game for everyone

Work? Optional. 
Friends? Only if they play Rust too",True,Strategy
Rust,"I've played on and off since release and the game has great potential but between the hackers/cheaters its begun to wear down my will to continue playing. The problem is there's nothing like it out there, therefore I'll likely continue playing. 

They need to stop focusing on new updates for the game and fix the current problems with hackers. They can get banned then buy a new account for $5-$15 online through the black market then right back on the game.
It happens far to often and once you've been hacked on nothing can be done to fix the situation they put you in. It's time wasted & it happens far too often.",False,Strategy

Rust,"I am extremely frustrated with the ongoing issues I have encountered while trying to open and play Rust. After purchasing the game for 40 Euros, I have been unable to even test it due to a persistent startup error that prevents the game from launching. This is incredibly disappointing, especially considering the amount of money I spent.

I have followed every troubleshooting step provided by the developers, including all the solutions listed for startup errors. Unfortunately, none of these steps have resolved the issue. As a paying customer, I expected a more reliable experience, and I feel completely let down by this situation.

At this point, I am seriously considering requesting a refund, as I have been unable to play the game at all. Furthermore, I am contemplating leaving the worst possible rating for Rust to highlight the frustration and disappointment this issue has caused me. It is unacceptable to pay for a game and not even have the chance to experience it due to technical problems.

I sincerely hope that the developers address this issue promptly so that others do not have to go through the same frustration.

all that being said. 
i love this game!!!
i have found when things go right on this game there is no better feeling, the insane loops of high's and pitfalls is what has driven me to push on.
now almost 200 hours in this game i feel like i can give a fair point of view.
there is a level of toxicness in the game but that should be expected with all online games. but the pros far outweigh the cons.
As i have met some amazing people online, and ended up teaming with them now we talk daily on discord.
all i can say to new players like myself is just carry on and make an effort to learn all the complexities of the game as i can promise you will be rewarded .

Rust,"Rust Review – 155 Hours In
After 155 hours in Rust, I can confidently say that this game is one of the most brutal yet rewarding survival experiences out there. By now, I’ve gone through the full cycle of Rust life—waking up on the beach with a rock, getting raided countless times, and finally establishing a solid base and thriving.

The Good:
✅ Intense PvP & Raiding – Gunfights are adrenaline-pumping, and nothing beats the thrill of executing a perfect raid (or defending against one).
✅ Satisfying Progression – Starting from nothing and eventually dominating with guns, explosives, and a fortified base feels amazing.
✅ Dynamic Player Interactions – From forming temporary alliances to getting betrayed, no two wipes are the same.
✅ Deep Base-Building & Crafting – The blueprint system and constant updates keep the game fresh.

The Frustrating:
❌ Harsh Learning Curve – Even after 155 hours, I still get outplayed by experienced groups, and solo play can be brutal.
❌ Time-Consuming – Maintaining a base and staying competitive requires serious dedication. If you’re offline too long, expect to come back to a raided base.
❌ Toxic Community – While there are some friendly players, Rust is infamous for its kill-on-sight mentality and trash talk.

Verdict:
At 155 hours, Rust is still an addictive experience, but it’s clear that the game rewards those who can put in the time. If you love the challenge and chaos of survival PvP, Rust delivers in spades. Just be prepared for heartbreak, betrayal, and plenty of salt along the way.

Portal 2,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

Portal 2,"Rating: 10/10

Developed by Valve and released in 2011, Portal 2 is a masterpiece of puzzle-platforming, featuring brilliant level design, sharp humor, and one of the most memorable narratives in gaming. Expanding on the mechanics of the original Portal (2007), this sequel introduces new puzzle elements, a longer and richer story, and an incredibly fun co-op mode. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys brain-teasing challenges and witty writing.

Why Portal 2 is a Masterpiece
🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Mechanics
The core of Portal 2’s gameplay remains the portal gun, allowing players to create two connected portals to navigate through puzzles. However, this sequel introduces new elements like:

Excursion Funnels (tractor beams that carry objects and players)
Repulsion Gel (bouncy surfaces for high jumps)
Propulsion Gel (speed-enhancing surfaces)
Light Bridges and Aerial Faith Plates
Each of these elements adds depth and variety, keeping puzzles fresh throughout the campaign.

🎭 Incredible Writing and Humor
Portal 2’s dialogue is legendary. The writing team, led by Erik Wolpaw, delivers some of the funniest and smartest lines in gaming history. GLaDOS, the sarcastic AI antagonist, returns with passive-aggressive insults and dark humor, while Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, provides an energetic and often hilarious presence. The game’s humor is perfectly balanced, making it both funny and deeply engaging.

🏢 Expanded World-Building
Unlike the first game, which mostly took place in sterile test chambers, Portal 2 explores the history of Aperture Science. Players venture into old, decayed sections of the facility, uncovering audio logs of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture. This deeper lore makes the world feel more alive and mysterious.

🤝 Co-op Mode – A Perfect Two-Player Experience
Portal 2 features a fully-fledged cooperative mode, where two players control Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots. Co-op puzzles require teamwork, timing, and communication, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming. It’s brilliantly designed, ensuring both players feel equally involved in solving the challenges.

🎶 Memorable Soundtrack
Portal 2’s soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, features dynamic music that adapts to player actions. The game also ends with another hilarious song from GLaDOS, ""Want You Gone"", following up on the iconic ""Still Alive"" from the first game.

Are There Any Flaws?
❌ Some Puzzles May Feel Too Easy for Veterans
Compared to the original Portal, some experienced puzzle-solvers might find Portal 2’s difficulty a bit more forgiving. However, the co-op mode and community-created test chambers provide plenty of challenging content.

❌ No Portal 3... Yet
The biggest flaw? Valve never made a Portal 3. 😢

Conclusion
Portal 2 is a masterpiece that balances clever puzzle design, fantastic humor, and deep world-building into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, the game delivers one of the most rewarding and entertaining adventures ever made. It remains one of Valve’s greatest achievements and is highly recommended for any gamer.

Portal 2,"playing this series has been life changing and i am not kidding. such an amazingly written game. it's witty, it's cynical, and NEVER gets boring. im way over a decade late but i hope i can be forgiven (i didnt really have access to a good pc growing up). to anyone else who is as well; play both games, you won't regret it. it's famous for a reason. plus, the soundtrack is almost under-talked about imo. it is very uniquely composed in the best way possible. 100/10",True,Strategy
Portal 2,Takes the semi tech demo vibe of the first game and instills it an incredible story led by a legendary character and a legendary vocal performance. I don't think a third game will live up to this game's legacy and I do not think it is worth trying.,True,Strategy
Portal 2,"Ah, Portal 2. The portal gun is iconic. When platforming games and puzzle games are done well it can make for a very satisfying game but when they are both done well with a unique concept/mechanics.... *chef's kiss*

If you somehow don't know anything about the portal series, or if you're just considering trying it out, go for it. It is truly unique and iconic. OR, if you're like me and you have it but never finished it, I highly recommend you do so.

Portal 2,Portal 2 is one game I hesitated to get it but believe the reviews the game is super fun and challenging. Even in co op mode the levels are very intriguing there is no music just focus on the challenge with your friends.

Portal 2,"Here at Aperture Science we believe in unique mechanics, amazing storytelling, and top notch graphics. Portal 2 was and still is a very good game. It's easily one of the more replayable games out there. Thanks to the boys up in research development, there's always something you didn't notice before, or a way to solve a test that was different from the last time. Not only is the main story great, but the multiplayer Co-Op mode is loads of fun. Then there's the addition of community test chambers. There are so many great chambers out there, some even with their own custom story lines! Crowd Sourcing chambers was definitely the right direction! The game basically never ends! It's only over when your brain is fried from solving puzzles! Good one Caroline! All in all it's amazing game that will keep you engaged, and our investors happy. So get to testing, before I put you fighting the humanoid praying mantis horde! Cave Johnson out!",True,Strategy
Portal 2,"🚀 9/10 - Would solve mind-bending puzzles again! 🚀

Portal 2 is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever made. Valve took the innovative mechanics of the original Portal and expanded them into a full-fledged, unforgettable experience filled with ingenious puzzles, top-tier storytelling, and dark humor that never gets old.

🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Design: The portal gun is back, and with new mechanics like gels, light bridges, and excursion funnels, every chamber feels fresh and rewarding. The game does an incredible job of gradually introducing new elements while keeping the challenge engaging.

🎭 Unmatched Writing & Voice Acting: GLaDOS returns with her signature sarcastic wit, but the new characters—especially Wheatley (voiced by Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J.K. Simmons)—steal the show with hilarious, yet compelling dialogue. The storytelling is immersive, and the plot twists are genuinely jaw-dropping.

🎮 Co-op Mode = Pure Fun: The cooperative mode is a masterpiece in itself. Solving puzzles with a friend while laughing at their inevitable portal mishaps is an experience like no other. The teamwork and communication required make for some of the best multiplayer moments in gaming.

🏆 A Must-Play for Everyone: Whether you love puzzle games, rich storytelling, or just experiencing a game with some of the best writing in history, Portal 2 is an absolute must-play. Even after all these years, it remains a gold standard for game design.

💙 Final Verdict: A flawless blend of humor, intelligence, and innovation. If you haven't played it yet, stop reading and play it NOW! 🚀🔵🟠

Don’t get me wrong, this is one of the best “have fun with friends” type games with a fun Arcade, Bowling Alley, and Casino but those are where you always see the majority of players, leaving things like the Minigames area and Server Events completely dead. Some things require 2 to 4 players to start so it’s impossible to even try them out. The game isn’t exactly dead with they’re being at least 2 servers (one on the East Coast and the other on the West Coast) that are almost full with 2 having about half capacity. The other major issue I have with the game is the UGC/Workshop content being extremely unoptimized. I have a decent PC that can run games like Doom Eternal and Apex Legends at max graphics with 60fps with no issue but have a hard time running the game in populated servers and I only assume this is because of the Custom Avatars. The other big turn away is the price where I got the game for about 50-70% off a few years ago and have been wanting to get it for a few friends but haven’t seen it go on sale. I do think that having the game be paid for is a much better option than doing something like VR chat dose with a subscription service but I think $20 (USD) is too much.

Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"This is such a classic, that will go down into history as one of the video game masterpieces (including the huge ending controversy that happened when ME3 released). It is a brilliant game, created in a process that will never work again for the industry. If anyone is interested in video game history and experiencing something unique that never again will see the day of light, they should play this game. Highly recommend for those who are looking to widen their understanding of what games were like in the past. 

For me story is everything. And BioWare had something very unique on top of their very talented developers and artists, and that was a real writing team with real editors. The depth and passion in the stories, the character development and the setting was incredible in all their games. This is the part that we will never see again. As someone that has worked in the industry for almost 20 years, it is with sadness I understand  that any developers now days do not use real Writers and replace them with Narrative Designers only (not really the same thing for those who wonder). The lack of investment will never give fruit to games like this again. For us who love the stories, the lore and the world systems, we will forever be starved by half baked shallow productions for ever more.

🎮 Overview
Mass Effect Legendary Edition is the definitive way to experience BioWare’s iconic space opera trilogy. Featuring remastered graphics, gameplay enhancements, and all single-player DLCs, this collection delivers an unforgettable journey through the galaxy with Commander Shepard at the helm.

🔥 What’s New?
- Visual Overhaul: Enhanced textures, improved lighting, and 4K HDR support make the galaxy more breathtaking than ever.
- Gameplay Improvements: Mass Effect 1 benefits from modernized gunplay, better AI, and refined controls, making it less clunky.
- Unified Experience: Character models, UI elements, and controls have been streamlined across all three games for consistency.
- All Single-Player DLCs: Over 40 DLCs, including Lair of the Shadow Broker, Leviathan, and Citadel, are included.
🌌 The Good
✅ Unparalleled Storytelling – A rich, emotional narrative with deep character arcs, tough moral choices, and a world that reacts to your decisions.
✅ Memorable Characters – From Garrus and Liara to Wrex and Tali, every squadmate feels unique and well-developed.
✅ Choice-Driven Gameplay – Decisions carry weight across all three games, influencing relationships, alliances, and even who survives.
✅ Refined Combat – Especially in ME1, where movement, aiming, and cover mechanics have been vastly improved.
✅ Fantastic Soundtrack – The legendary score, from the haunting ""Vigil"" to the adrenaline-pumping ""Suicide Mission,"" is unforgettable.

🤔 The Not-So-Good
❌ No Multiplayer – Mass Effect 3’s multiplayer mode is missing, which some fans might miss.
❌ Aged Animations – While improved, some facial animations and lip-syncing still feel outdated.
❌ Limited ME3 Ending Changes – While the Extended Cut DLC is included, the original ending still divides fans.

🎭 Verdict
Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a love letter to both longtime fans and newcomers. It revitalizes one of gaming’s greatest trilogies while preserving its heart and soul. If you love sci-fi, RPGs, or story-driven games, this is a must-play.

Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"[h1]Too Late to the Party[/h1]

Mass Effect is widely regarded as one of gaming’s pinnacle RPG experiences. Sadly, I never had the chance to experience it as a child and only recently played it for the first time. While I understand that Mass Effect was a phenomenal RPG in its time, I don't think it holds up in today’s gaming world.

Some of my biggest issues with the series are its clunky and shallow combat, one-dimensional quests, and lack of a true RPG experience. The combat and build-crafting feel like afterthoughts rather than core elements of the game. The level and quest design are extremely restrictive in terms of player agency and, apart from a few exceptions, largely forgettable. Also, the RPG mechanics are disappointingly shallow. There’s little incentive to experiment with different playstyles or choices, and even the narrative side of role-playing feels two-dimensional. The morality system doesn't add much depth to decision-making; it simply exists for superficial character-building.

Now for the good parts. Where Mass Effect excels, it truly shines. The world-building is simply top-tier. The universe of Mass Effect is so well-crafted that I almost considered recommending the game based on that alone. However, strong world-building alone doesn’t justify its lengthy runtime, especially when the negatives outweigh the positives.

All in all, I don’t think the Mass Effect trilogy is worth playing anymore. The RPG genre has evolved so much since Mass Effect's release, and the series doesn’t offer anything particularly special to justify a modern RPG fan’s time. I know my criticisms may make me sound like someone who doesn’t appreciate older games, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Some older games remain timeless, while others simply show their age. Sadly, Mass Effect falls into the latter category.",False,Strategy

The story and lore was captivating, yet during Mass Effect 3 I felt that several elements were rushed or underutilized. It was somewhat okay, but I can't help but feel that segment could been done alot better.

I personally rate this game a 8.5 out of 10.",True,Strategy
Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"The games included in this remaster are great. You get the base games and all DLCs in one package (excluding pinnacle station).

The EA app is mandatory and at some periods of time the signing in just doesn't work. Meaning you are locked out of the game you bought. This is just another anti-consumer practice by EA.

Like when you make desicions from the 1st game it can carry on into the 3rd game and its lot desicions that has to make lol and can be affected to your gameplay and story (and ending).
The sci-fi setting, which is rare in RPGs, is handled really really well. And the gameplay is good too, especially in the 2nd and 3rd game. The story despite some flaws ( like the ending part maybe ), is easily one of the best I’ve ever experienced. And what truly makes this trilogy stand out is its characters. Garrus, Mordin, EDI, Joker, Legion, Liara, Thane and many more are all brilliantly written. And of course, there’s my beloved quarian gf Tali’Zorah vas Normandy :v . And there is so many good dialogue or hearthbroken dialogue for example like the Garrus goodbye dialogue or all Tali (romanced) dialogue, she's just so cute :v .
For the price (well i got this like 92% discount at that time lol), this trilogy is an absolute masterpiece. It’s easily one of the best game trilogies I’ve ever played.

Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"Best Series I have ever played tied with Kotor 1 and Kotor 2. Every game is a 10 for me, been replaying them all for 10 years. Top notch story, top notch game play, super fun and super addicting. Like a good book you can't put down",True,Strategy
Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"I'm a big fan of KOTOR and sci-fi in general, but this was just disappointing. It wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't good either. The story is uninteresting, there is almost no chemistry between the characters, and the dialogue feels artificial. There are also a lot of bugs, especially with the vehicles that can fall through the ground and the only way to recover is to load the last save. Great soundtrack though.

ME1: If I were to call it a B game, it would be a compliment. The squad is pretty useless, they are only good at getting in the way and dying. Well, and some biotic abilities while your abilities recharge. The levels feel like they were generated and not designed. They are just not interesting. Enemies keep getting stuck in walls and the controls are terrible, especially for vehicles. There's also this fake open world that you can't return to once you've finished the main story. Although I liked the weapons without thermal clips and the skill system in this game more than what happened afterwards.

ME2: Action has been improved, but at the expense of RPG. I still hate the controls (one spacebar does it all). Leveling up is now completely pointless. But they finally taught Shepard how to run without getting tired after 10 seconds =). The levels are much better, now it looks like there were designers at work. Some of the locations were very nice, and I enjoyed the variety of levels (as opposed to always driving a vehicle between hangars). Squad mates have gotten a bit better, they can even kill an enemy or two now, but they still get in the way every now and then and block you against the wall or cover. Dialogue is still artificial and the story is not properly directed. 
I started ME3 right after that, importing my character, and I felt like there was a gap between the two games, even though I had completed all the journal missions in ME2. I had to search online and discovered that there is a story from a DLC that bridges the gap between the games! If it's related to the main story, why wasn't it a priority mission and I only found it in the quest after searching online?
Anyway, it was a vast improvement on ME1, but I still wouldn't recommend it.

ME3: Pure action, no RPG at all (with bad controls, everything is done with the spacebar again). The squad is actually useful now, they don't die all the time and actually help with something (and not just there to have an opinion on everything and stop you for boring dialogues). The levels with Reapers in the background are spectacular, and it's the only time the environment feels epic (in this ""space saga""). This is where I learned why the previous games needed so much artificial dialogue - to show you cameos in every level. There was 1 mission in all 3 games that I actually enjoyed - the Shore Leave DLC. It was the only time this whole circus felt like a team loyal to each other. And then it went back to empty pathos. The ending(s) and the conclusion of this story were deeply disappointing and make the Mass Effect trilogy arc for me some of the worst sci-fi I have ever read, played or watched.",False,Strategy
Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"Didnt expect to actually fall so hard for this series, but the story and world building around it pulls you in a lot. One of the best games you can play story wise, only BG3 made me feel in a way sad after ending it, knowing it is all done. The gameplay in ME2 and 3 is actually decent, but I have to admit, ME1 is the weakest in that perspective. There isnt a lot of variety in the exploration/side missions, as most of them involve you just using the mako to scout different minerals in each map with the usual 2-3 points of interest which tend to be the same. However, the next 2 games are completely different, each having their own interactions on the galaxy map, and a different type of exploration. Overall, it is definitely worth playing through each game in order, since they all connect to each other and deepens the lore. Unfortunately you need the shitty EA launcher to play this peak series, which forces you to be connected to the internet when you log in, even if youre playing a single player game.",True,Strategy
Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"Why do people treat this game with such reverence? 

World design is surprisingly dull. The citadel has some imaginative sights, but level design is noticeably sparse and recycled. A lot of time is spent on truly inane cookie cutter planets where you drive around for a while scanning junk before moving on, with barely enough mission content to keep you engaged. Then there's the squad members who I thought would offer meaningfully to the dialogue but hardly contribute more than a interjection or two per mission.

But what really made me throw in the towel was how every single facet of movement, combat, party management, etc is absolute horsesh!t. Enemies are damage sponges (telltale sign of bad design) and your squad mates are totally unreliable beyond placing themselves in enemy line of fire and taking some hits for you. Player and party abilities are uninteresting and cumbersome to use, and I resented being expected to manually activate them for the entire squad. Now I don't really like party-based RPGs, but if you do I'm sure you can find better candidates elsewhere. 

So what does the game do right exactly? The story and writing are good, and that's about it. It could make a good tv series or D&D campaign, but as a video game it completely misses the mark.",False,Strategy

While the ending of the third is far from perfect, the rest of the journey of that game will have you in tears, fighting a losing battle you're convinced you can win. Play these games. The game play is ok, the writing is fantastic, the journey unforgettable.",True,Strategy
Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"Overall, if you try and play all 3 in a row, you'll get burned out if you're like me. The games aren't different enough to stave that off. I have gripes with each individual game though

1: The vast majority of worlds you can explore do not feel immersive at all, and the locations on them are made out of the exact same few prefabs with decorations arranged differently. If you do a lot of the non-main story stuff, you'll also have tons of time where you're just not doing RPG things at all.

2: Much much better in terms of story and immersive locations, and it's probably my favourite overall. I feel like this one has the worst of the new ammo system and being a cover shooter, and they don't give you quite enough spare ammo. I found the DLC for stopping the Reapers coming early to be really out of place though. It doesn't have nearly enough weight given to it in terms of the seriousness of the threat vs. how it feels when going through it.

3: Has the best game feel out of the 3, with much better cover mechanics and gunplay. The worst thing about 3 to me was the Citadel DLC though. It feels completely out of place compared to the main story, and has a way more comedic tone than any other part of the game. It just feels like they had the idea, and found a way to make it work, but it would be way better off just not being included.

Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"Headline: ""My main problem with Mass Effect FOR YEARS was literally that it was unplayable because the game crashes and crashes and crashes; this version fixed that.""

I bought the original two games on Steam before this remaster came out and this remaster is BLOWING my mind.

Playtime for the original games:
The original ME1 without any DLC: 4.6 hrs
The original ME2 without any DLC: 3.9hrs

Why do I have such little playtime?

The original PC releases that are still being sold on Steam have horrible controller support and do not support my native resolution (1920x1080). I got as far as recruiting Tali in the original version of ME1 AND THE GAME BLUE SCREENED MY PC... I use the latest version of Windows 11 and I have never experienced a Blue Screen Of Death ever since I installed Windows, literally except with the original release of ME1.

The reason I am recommending this version with only 4.5hrs of playtime is because THIS VERSION FIXED my Blue Screen issue. Legendary Edition is optimized for modern PCs so it doesn't crash my PC no more.

Due to these technical errors I uninstalld the ga,e after a few hours and was 1000% missing out on the fun. This is why my playtime is so low in the original ME1 and ME2. I started playing this Remastered version the same day I am posting this review (which is why I only have 4 hours while reviewing this, I just started a new game) and I'm amazed by how actually playable this version of the game is, as well as how all my technical problems are gone.

My main problem with Mass Effect FOR YEARS was literally that it was unplayable because the game crashes and crashes and crashes; this version fixed that. It has been really disheartening for me to not be able to play ""one of the greatest franchises of all-time"" because it just didn't run at all and I want to thank BioWare for remastering this trilogy so I can FINALLY see why everyone loves this franchise.",True,Strategy

Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"It is glitchy, at times it doesn't look better than the original, and you can get soft locked. But, overall, a well done upgrade over the original versions and what's most important it allows you to mostly seamlessly play through all 3 games easily enough. It just works out of the box in a modern computer with a 4k monitor, it preserves what made those games great without headache, and that makes it the best way to (re)experience the trilogy.

As for the original games, the first game has a lot of soul, the second game is the best... And the third game is a bit live action and mostly about tying loose ends. They are exactly what they ought to have been. You first get sucked in by the world building and a simple narrative, then you experience an expanded world in depth, then you can either end the story in single player or grind to your hearth's content in MP. The best way to play through the series is doubtless with an open eye for side quests, patience for the story, and going through all 3 games in order with character transfer. Things you do in ME1 will affect ME3, truly a trilogy made by people who cared.

A brief reminder that this game does support mods.",True,Strategy
Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"Mass Effect 1: Though the game is very dated, the remaster does a lot to bring it into the modern age. The combat is greatly improved, though still a bit clunky. But the story, choices and characters are what make this game great and they have aged wonderfully. The control of the Mako vehicle still sucks though and the missions finding minerals and outposts while driving are still straight up painful as the Mako is very difficult to traverse the constant steep sections of the maps.

Mass Effect 2: A huge step forward in game design, this entry boasts the largest cast of any of the games. Some, like Jacob, do feel like a bit of filler though. ME2 has some of the most interesting choices though. The combat is a big improvement over the first game. Scanning planets for elements gets pretty tedious pretty fast but upgrading the ship is a lot of fun. I liked the ending of this game the most out of any of them.

Mass Effect 3: By far the most modern game of any in the series. The cast is much smaller than the previous entries, I would have liked more interaction with previous squad-mates. There is a ton of content here, I played ME3 for more than ten hours longer than ME2 or ME1. The story is still excellent and the edited endings are acceptable. I like the bleak tone of the game and I felt very sad yet satisfied having finished all three games with the same character.

DLCs: Legendary Edition includes almost all DLCs for all of the games. Some are better than others but there is a lot of extra content that really fleshes out the world and the story. I didn't play any of the DLCs back in the day when I played the original trilogy.

I also feel Star Control 2. (alias The Ur-Quan Masters) had some notable influence on this game.
Cons: squad inventory management is nightmarishly tedious. Also, not having an option to manage squadmates not in the current squad setup is lame. While the main storyline missions are sufficiently worked out, side quests (assignments) are pretty dull and one-dimensional. Also character development (Shepard, squadmates and NPCs, too) could be a bit more complex. Also, dialogue quality is somewhat below the standard estabilished by the KotOR series.

My only change would be some way of knowing within the game what is DLC content and what is not. In many cases, you miss out on certain DLC content interactions if you have not progressed through certain main content. The party in your apartment is a shining example, if you are not far enough along on one of your romance interests a few cut scenes are completely omitted. Just pay attention online and try and finish the main content up to certain major shift points then roll the DLC content to get everything from the game.

Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition,"So, in regards to performance, you're probably going to want to disable ALL in game overlays (especially the EA overlay) for the games to run smoothly without random crashes on certain levels or planets. I also had to turn the graphics way down on ME1 and ME3 to prevent crashes, but ME2 ran perfectly on default settings without even losing a frame.
This was my first time playing the Mass Effect trilogy (bought it on sale for 5 bucks) and it was awesome to do so from one launcher. I beat ME1 on normal difficulty; then played both a fem shep Adept, and a male Shep vangaurd through the entire trilogy on insanity. I can see myself playing more in future, I'd like to try every class. One thing I got to appreciate is how much effort the devs put into changing things up in each installment of the series. There's something I really love about each one, and I could probably add a lot details here, but instead I will leave you with the immortal words of commander Shepard...

Can’t express how good this trilogy and franchise is. Every single minute was totally worth it, and they did an awesome job with the remasters for ME1 and ME2. It’s a story you build brick by brick with every decision you make, taking you through all kinds of emotions from start to finish. The amount of detail and love these games had back then is exactly why Bioware earned its reputation (despite some of the mistakes they made in recent years).


On the other hand, in terms of gameplay... I will just say is [b] tough [/b]. Is not a mess but it can be quite uncomfortable at times. I get that it’s probably intentional, part of the game’s identity and all of them are kinda old games (ME1 is 18 years old already) but camera and animations sometimes can make you dizzy and have to take breaks now and then.

Another thing worth mentioning is the weird system changes between games, like the removal of certain features. It really makes me wonder why they made some of those decisions back then. Still, it’s totally worth your time to dive into this universe and enjoy every part of it.

Thank you Bioware, for creating such an awesome experience to play.

Minor gripes include the ME2 character importer burning the eyebrows off my custom Shepherd, and for some reason you have to MANUALLY TYPE the code from ME1 (dozens of characters) into ME2 in order to customise it.

No Man's Sky,"For a very long time i claimed it just wasn't for me. I played it at a friend's house on console back in 2016 or 2017 and if you haven't heard about the launch it wasn't... great. So I wrote it off until last year after I heard all the work that went into it and the depth of mechanics and it sounded like an all new game so I got it, booted it, immediately got overwhelmed and returned it. But it kept eating at me that there was more to learn and do and when it went on sale again I told myself I was just gonna read every tutorial and not worry about all the warnings going off when you start it.

The big thing that turned me off was when you start a new game all your systems have gone down and you need to one-by-one repair everything and that was scaring me, but I can blame that on myself not liking multi-stressor situations and getting scared and confused. Menu nav was a little confusing but that's also me being a bad typist. But now that I'm back i can say I really like it.

It's a LOT of resource management. Different planets have different hazards that drain different shields that take different fuels to recharge. And I'm ok with that because discovering and building and upgrading everything is so much fun. I found a really nice nature planet early on and put a base there, then you can build a teleporter and power it with the sun so I can visit it any time. I'm learning the languages and discovering ruins and treasure, running away from fights because I'm weak as balls, and you just keep finding new planets and it feels so good.

So far I have jumped one system and made almost no progress because I'm just having so much fun wandering and learning. It's a big hurdle at first but once you realize how easy it is to find starship fuel and other necessities it's a lot easier to just wander and have fun. I'm glad I didn't give up on it and I'm glad Hello Games didn't give up on it either. Definitely give it a chance.",True,Strategy
No Man's Sky,"This is an odd review. I have over 100 hours in the game but I am giving it the thumbs down and don't have any horror story about the game glitching and destroying my base or my save being corrupted. Quite the opposite, I enjoyed the game and will probably play more of it. So why the negative review? 

The short of it is that the game is not only ""a mile wide and an inch deep"" as many have said before but also a disjointed mess and a stunning example of having all the right parts but failing to put them together well. Now in spite of that the game is still enjoyable at times as a brain off, mining/exploring, number go up grind, but lacks a real sense of payoff. There are much better games to scratch that itch and don't cost $60. If you are interested and the game is on sale for over 50% I'll say go for it but at full price this game is just too buggy and too shallow for me to say it is worth it.

The long of it. 
There are 18 quintillion planets and no meaningful reason to visit most of them. The number of planets and moons in the game is impressive until you learn the basics of combinatorics and the fact that you can get that many combinations pretty easily out of a bare handful of meaningful and not so meaningful distinctions across categories like biome, animal genus, storm frequency, mineral types, resource abundance, etc. This part of the blandness of No Man's Sky has been covered to death and I don't think I have anything more to add. I will say that it is impressive at first, but very quickly (within the first 10 systems I visted for me) you will find yourself completely uninterested in exploring or even scanning the planets beyond whatever mission or search for resources led you to the system.

Progress is meaningless except as a way to reduce annoyance, and progress is all paid for. You progress in No Man's Sky by getting inventory expansion upgrades which expand your tech and storage slots for your multitool/exosuit/ship, finding tool/weapon techs for your ship/multitool/exosuit which offer some ""new"" functionality, finding upgrade modules that provide stat increases to those tool/weapon techs, unlocking crafting recipes for consumeable items (special ammo, charge packs, fuel packs) or trade goods, and unlocking buildables for base building or to access exocrafts (land/water vehicles). Inventory expansion only serve to let you play the game longer between going to your base or a station to offload stuff. Tool upgrades give you access to the ability to gather resources that you can usually already get through refining or which don't have any use except for making money or give you the abilities like selling things from anywhere or refining without having to drop down a building. The upgrade modules biggest buff is to letting you run longer or have to recharge items less frequently or do the same tasks faster. The crafting recipes for consumables usually give you the option to just carry fewer things to be able to recharge stuff. The crafting recipes for making money are brain dead and unfortunately the most important ones. The base building tools are a mess since there is very little benefit to making anything more than tiny bases. The exocraft are usefull except of course that you have a starship that can fly in atmosphere and explore 10x faster with. Here is the kicker, all of these ways to progress can be bought from easily accessible vendors and apart from a little while at the start of the game, you will have a much easier time just buying the upgrades. Imagine if in minecraft after getting a stone pickaxe you progressed not by gathering iron and smelting it to make a better pickaxe but instead sold apples to buy one. That is what the progress system of No Man's Sky is like. This isn't an ""optimizing the fun out of the game issue."" If you want some sort of upgrade whether a new multitool or ship or upgrade module, you have to grind exploring blindly for it to drop from a point of interest or to find the merchant to buy it from if it isn't one of the types of upgrades available at literally every station.

Friction and bad UI. These may seem like minor gripes but they build up to be excruciating. By default pretty much every interaction with a menu in No Man's Sky requires a 1 second button press or some drag and drop interaction. NPC speech can't be skipped or significantly sped up either. You can turn off most of the 1 second delays, but not all of them. This might not sound that bad, except literally every menu or NPC interaction has easily 5-10 seconds of empty time padded into it by these delays or even just little animations. Now also consider that everything is blocked by this padded time interaction scheme with no bulk operations for many common tasks. Trying to give effigies to raise your reputation with an alien species? Gotta do it one by one going through the same 3 dialogue windows. Trying to turn in the daily trade item? ONE. AT. A. TIME. This of course hasn't even touched on the crafting, which is a mess. You only see 6 items at a time when acessing a crafting or refining menu so I hope you like scrolling through the 100s of different item types with no search function. Adding friction to a process is a useful way to lead people to doing things a different way in games, but everything in No Man's Sky has just insane amounts of needlessly wasted time to do anything.

Bugs. Bugs. Bugs. The game is buggy. They weren't game breaking bugs for me, but from the forums I can see that there are quite a few of those. You will have to restart frequently to get buildings to place and work or for your base to spawn in or for a mission objective to complete, it kills the momentum even if the game isn't unplayable.

Disjointedness. The game feels like a mess, you go from 0 to 60 or hit a wall with no leads or just steam roll the tasks you are given. This largely stems from the fact that the main way to progress in terms of abilities is not to explore and gather resources or make discoveries, but from buying things. However, there are missions to unlock some things too, which are the barest pretext of a fetch quest. If you approach this game like Terraria, Minecraft, or any other survival/crafting/exploration games in that vein you will be very confused because for all of the quintillion planets and dozens of resources, all of them are useless compared to the almighty dollar. Except of course when it is being gated by a side quest with no hint at it being necessary to unlock the thing you want. There are so many types of multiools or ships, but unless you want to grind fixing and upgrading a new tool/ship, there is no reason to. You can do everything in the game easily with the starter multitool and ship after upgrading them. This is made doubly worse by the fact that so many of the reasons for why you might use a different type of ship or multitool are hidden and not hinted at in game. So many basic stats and explanations are obfuscated in this game. I assume to give a sense of discovery, but there is no good motivation to explore new ships/tools because you can already do everything easily enough with what you have and there are clearly useful upgrades you could focus on.

This has gone on long enough and is starting to ramble. I focused on what I didn't like but I would like to say again, I have enjoyed a lot of the time I spent playing No Man's Sky. I just mainly think there are a lot better ways to spend your time and money.",False,Strategy

I spent a good amount of time in it and had enjoy my time, however it get to a point where everything kind of feel stale. This game is much better with other people, but that is where it end for me. I enjoy exploring, but after a while, every planet start feeling the same. You either scan all the life forms and minerals around or go around finding things around the map. They are repeated on every planet by the way. On top of all of this, the quests are very bland. They are all fetch quests or go from point A to B. This include the main quests. I can only do so many of these before I say this is boring. The grind for better things and having a huge amount of money also feel like it not that important in this game. I mean what the point of money if there is nothing to buy? What the point of the most powerful S class ship if nothing could kill you when you were in your basic C class ship fully upgraded?

For as long as this game has been out, it's crazy to me that it's this broken. Right now I can't even edit my base. I have to restart the whole base if I mess up. The quests are constantly broken. I HAD to download a save editor in order to progress my quests because they keep breaking! The most interesting aspect of this game is planet discovery (imo). Finding cool ships and all that is meaningless unless you have something to use them for (imo). So when the game puts a giant string of required quests that have to be completed in order to unlock new planets, and when the quests are broken (and genuinely awful to complete, they are so boring, i mean the atlas quest wasn't so bad, it was interesting, but any and everything else was a slog), it's just really frustrating. These quests have you flying back and forth between two places over and over again. Just to make a phone call half the time 😭. These quests essentially just have you going to another location that is exactly the same as before but with 5 more text boxes of story each time. They don't even give you the exact coordinates, they make you land and walk around to find it 😭.

No Man's Sky,"If you love chill grinding and endless exploration, this is your game! There is a real coolness here, but...

I simply need more of a connection to the universe itself.
It's not really dangerous to do anything.
The NPCs really feel like placeholders (desperately need voice overs).
The space stations feel really, really dated, ultra minimalistic feeling. 
The space station/teleporter mechanic makes it so you don't get that ""middle of nowhere"" vibe one might expect in a game like this.
On that note, the constant emergence of NPC spaceships appearing and flying around everywhere is so weird. It's like I'm in downtown New York no matter where I go, traffic everywhere. I just want to get away from civilization lol!
It really really really needs a sense of survival beyond hazardous conditions... seriously.
And, I guarantee any PS3 airplane/spaceship game had equal or better flight mechanics.

Then I'm stuck for the next 5 minutes alternately flying and running to the location because neither the jetpack or running last very long. Also  I suffer far more damage using the jetpack and running into things or falling unexpectedly when the jetpack runs out then by any other means.

2. The bugs, for an example being in a co-op lobby, most of the times, sentinals are bugged, they just dont spawn, or when you kill all of them, the next round doesn't spawn, so you have to wait for the timer run out before you can do anything.

It's very ambitious, which is impressive. The technology is easy to take for granted. But man the game gets in its own way A LOT. 

Every game session I encounter a handful of new bugs and a handful of old bugs which range from benign to game crashing to infuriating to perplexing. You can never really trust that anything will work or that any of the info the game is giving you is trustworthy. Inputs are often sluggish and unreliable (like swapping modes on your multi-tool, also why can you only swap in one direction?)

No Man's Sky,"If you're on the fence about this game, why?! Let me help you out with this.

Sure, this game started out a little rocky.  Nice little game that got boring really quick, but Hello Games took all the feedback to heart and and provided tons of updates over the years.  So let's look at some of the pros about this game:
* Added Expeditions to the game and then made them replayable so new players could earn bonus content they may have missed
*  Kept expanding the crafting system and base building system.
*  Plenty of missions to complete.
*  There are still some bugs during the play through, but Hello Games has always been very responsive about fixing them.
*  The game has tons of content to keep you busy for hours including the New Worlds 2 content just released for free.
*  The community is extremely supportive in helping you have a good time in Multiplayer (sometimes overly helpful).
*  If you don't want to play multiplayer, just turn it off in the settings and enjoy your private game.  And if you want to go back to mutiplayer, just enable it in the settings without having lose any of the work you put into the game so far.

Now, here's the reason you should support Hello Games with this game:
*  In the entire time that this game has been released, there has been no Purchasable DLC content.  It has all been released for free.
*  There are zero micro transactions in this game.  All things purchasable in game are done so with currency earned in game.
*  17 Expeditions (Seasons, if you will) all available for replay.

A message should be sent to other developers on the success of such a game to show that we should return game development to a time when DLCs were free (particularly those that should have been included in the original release of the game) and micro transactions didn't exist (although I'm ok with purchasing cosmetics, which this game makes available for free btw).

Now, any review wouldn't be true if it didn't show the cons of a game:
*  The game does get some new bugs with content release, but Hello Games has always been on top of fixing the issue so long as people report the issues through their ticketing system on their website.

No Man's Sky,"An original experience created by a tiny independent studio with overwhelming scope and a focus on exploration. The outstanding art direction and tone alone make it a joy to simply play. There are too many different ways to engage with this game for me to list here, but it shines brightest when enjoyed slowly over a long period of time. You will never experience everything this game has, why rush? 

I suggest you find a system with a few planets you like, explore each planet, name each creature, build a home for yourself (or a settlement for your people), and then take back to the stars! Make goals, take notes! Or don’t.

No Man's Sky,"This is sort of hesitant recommendation, more of a neutral review.

The game is good, but it has its drawbacks, what I didn't like might also appeal to others. What's good about the game is the sheer amount of possibilities of different things to do and see, but as for the downsides:
- the grind is very real, I ended up making a lot of resources with the duplication glitch only to stop the grind. You can build a mining rig, but that only takes care of some resources, and it still requires you to visit your mines and collect everything. There are a lot of other things to grind for, and it's half of why I wanted to write a negative review around 50 hours before I started to duplicate things.
- absolute majority of the content is generation, which means that there is no chance to see it all, but it gets somewhat repetitive starting at some point so maybe there's no need to see it all
- ships are randomly generated, too, so if you want a specific ship or want to make a collection, this might take infinite amount of time even with the help of the community
- a lot of actions require watching unskippable animation. It's not that long but when you have to see it for a hundredth time it really gets annoying
- some parts of the game look inspired by other games, which sometimes makes me feel like playing a simplified less interesting version of those other games
- there are still bugs, I think there are no game-breaking ones, but expect things to not always be smooth. For me the most annoying one was when player character disappear sometimes (except for the multitool), and sometimes other objects also disappear when I get close, making them uninteractable, too.
- some content looks half-made, like objects that seem to serve some purpose but don't (yet?). It's OK and the game keeps receiving updates so this is expected, I think.

All in all, I would recommend it on a discount maybe, and only if you're not annoyed by the thought of never being able to see/collect everything there is, and by the perspective of grinding for a lot of things.",True,Strategy
No Man's Sky,"All I heard about this game was how bad the release was, but I'm so glad I bought it. It's outstanding in so many ways, let me list some of them.

1. Phenomenal writing. From the mini text-adventures, to the overall plot, it's enough to make Isaac Asimov give a standing ovation from the grave. The moral and philosophical questions will stay with you long after the game is closed.

2. A grand technical achievement. Random generation is one thing, but random generation of almost everything, while linking it together with multiplayer, having it all load in real time and able to create save points and buildable bases is hardcore to say the least. The planets even have cloud formations and day-night cycles that are actually lit by their stars. The autopilot actually works, it even plots a course while bending around a planet. Someone give the lead engineer a medal.

3. The amount of content is ridiculous, it's like Minecraft and Subnautica merged into one. It's the kind of game you'll never uninstall.

No Man's Sky,"No Man's Sky is arguably the definition of a Redemption Story. To start, the game had an insane hype train, which was worthy because Hello Games was previously known for indie games that were frankly not serious and lacking in a core audience. To the everyday gamer they looked over Hello Games and stuck to their more familiar IPs that game studios have been beating to death with remakes that lack in radical change or continuity to the player bases wants and sometimes needs. Take for example the run of COD games that were essentially just carbon copies of the previous one with a new slapped on name and campaign. And yet, year over year, you would buy that new game, be it 50 or 60 dollars. Hello Games decided somewhere around 12 - 14 years ago that it was indeed time to look towards the future of their company and their change in heart netted a great idea, an infinite generation UNIVERSE, not galaxy, with so many planets that exploration would never stop. The great thing about their idea was also its initial fall from grace. This game released to a public gamer that was expecting so much, after all it was a dream being sold in the beginning. Hello Games was limited to their consumer base of Consoles and a few PC gamers. This also means that they were limited to the performance of the PS4, and Xbox consoles of the time. Then, playing the game was hard enough in HD, then the CPU draw on the game would often start up Sony Airlines, or start dropping frames on the Xbox of the time. These consoles weren't nearly as powerful as the ones we are blessed with today, and the game was destroyed on launch because Hello Games couldn't possible offer everything they truly wanted to offer, and still make the game playable, and ACCESSIBLE to the majority of people who would enjoy it. Getting to the point, Hello Games has constantly been working on this game, and no matter what price you would purchase it at, be it 60 dollars on Steam or on sale nearly everywhere all the time, THIS GAME IS WORTH IT. And if you ask me, an Enthusiast of Space Exploration games, playing games such as Elite Dangerous is so hard for the layman, and yet you get so much out of it if you spend the time to learn everything you can. Hello Games SMASHED my expectations, NMS is super accessible to a dummy, and a genuis, a brokie or a snob. This game will reward your hard work with the most beautiful views you never imagined, connect you with people you never knew existed, and unlike Elite Dangerous, the game will help you out at every turn. It has modes and single player only, and it has online, and a real economy. The game does what it aimed to do when it launched in mid-2016. It has EVERYTHING they aimed for, and yet they managed to add more still. Personally i think that Hello Games has to be the MOST HUMBLE of ANY game-dev studio EVER. They went from HATED to THE KING OF REDEMPTION, and all it took was for them to put their head down, work super hard, and deliver what their customers wanted, and show them things they never knew possible with a emphasis on showing off natural beauty, and maybe somewhere in NMS are planets that are outrageous, but it isn't aiming for ultra realism, its aiming to evoke that utterly natural need to EXPLORE AND CREATE. Love the story that NMS has had through the years, I seriously couldn't recommend this game enough, and i cannot wait to see how they surprise me further.

No Man's Sky,"[h1] Relaxation Game [/h1]
✅ Graphics
✅ Mechanics
❌ Long-Term

Great game for the story, interesting events, and building spacecraft. After you complete the main mission, you are left with tedious missions, that run through something you've done 100 times. The mechanics of the game is great, with interesting battles, freighters, and an engaging story.

[b] Details [/b]
Overtime, you stop scanning the planet for new species, because they're just the same decoration, but with a different look. You stop exploring the majority of worlds, as most of them are empty rocks, filled with predictable, single-biome terrain. Building is a nightmare if you are interested in detailed builds (especially because the connection points go everywhere except where you want them to). The biggest issue would be the bugs.

That sounds like a game-killer, but this game is so vast, it isn't. When you are in the mood for a relaxing game, this game is perfect after completion. Build the best freighter, build a base (with some struggle), create a city, dictate a village, fight pirates, and bully your friends. This game has climbed out of the ashes of it's release to provide an experience you can't quite get anywhere else. Every update keeps you around for a little longer. When they finish polishing the game, and truly begin introducing new features, this will be a game of endless exploration.

Should you play this game? Yes. It's more of an investment. In the future, I can see this game leaving a feeling different, but similar to Skyrim. A game that you can play for 1,000's of hours, still have millions of more things to do, and somehow, you can get on to play it, and experience the same feeling as when you picked it up.

No Man's Sky,"A fantastic game for a specific audience. If you're looking for limitless space exploration, lots of systems to engage in, spectacular views, and base building, you're going to love this game. That being said, if you're looking for deep gameplay with lots of fleshed-out RPG features, well...

The saying ""wide as an ocean, deep as a pond"" is quite descriptive of this game. Let's take combat. There are a variety of different types of weapon attachments for your multi-tool, from plasma blasters to shock grenades. There's different upgrades for all the weapon types, too, so you can try to get the best bang for your buck. But there's not really a reason to - combat is essentially just ""run and shoot."" There's not really a reason to use different weapon types unless you feel like it. Most enemies can be hid from by digging a hole in the ground.

What about exploration? There's a wide, nearly infinite array of worlds to explore and different creatures to find. Some of the environments are breathtaking and have harsh hazards you'll have to survive. But there's not really a point to explore outside of your own enjoyment - all the points of interest such as buildings or trading stations are copy-pasted and don't offer much in terms of mechanics or gameplay features. Walk around, find some scenic views and cool (and/or absurd) creatures, and trade with an alien or two. That's about all exploring is.

Story? Well, it's... there. To me, the story has been so vague that I have no connection to it whatsoever. Nearly all story-related dialogue can be described as ominous and incomplete hints, chock-full of static such as ""the BZZZTZZZ is going to BZZTZZZ."" Don't get me wrong, that's a fine dialogue quirk, especially in a space game. But it happens SO OFTEN. The characters, if you want to call them that, are soulless dispensaries of vaguely spooky space nonsense words. I feel no attachment to them at all. There IS a story to piece together, and there are plenty of videos and articles discussing it. It may be super interesting once all the dots are connected. But as a player avoiding such compilations so I can experience it myself, it's completely unappealing. There's nothing to string me along, no personal intrigue or conflict other than something about the number 16 repeating every other dialog line.

Don't get me wrong, I do recommend this game, and wouldn't have played it this many hours if I didn't enjoy it. But don't go into it expecting an RPG. This is a game of intrinsic motivation. Sure, there's stuff to do, upgrades to buy, bases to build. But there doesn't seem to be a point to any of it, no exciting greater narrative or characters to help string you along. You want to explore space in ways no video game has done before? Fly in and out of planet atmospheres with no loading times? Encounter billions of creatures, plants, and environments? Build an epic base? Deck out your spaceship with the best upgrades? Play this game! Just don't go in expecting an exciting, story-driven narrative with hours upon hours to be spent getting into the intricaces of each feature.",True,Strategy

I do have to commend Hello Games for sticking to their project, and turning it into something the player base enjoys. 

However, personally, this game is fairly mind numbing to me. It's endless routine tasks, I do not want to collect copper to make Chromatic Metal for the nth time so I can interact with a new mechanic. (Or at least, a mechanic new to me.) Discovering colonies was really cool, until i realized I am going to have to build and collect literally everything myself. What the hell is everyone else in the town doing? I could just go back to base building at this point, at least then I wouldn't have to arbitrarily wait for something to finish building AND collect all the materials myself.

The nail in the coffin for me was this most recent update - I heard by chance - that they finally added gas giants. Something I had wanted to explore since release since they'd always fascinated me, even as a child. 

And they aren't gas giants. Titan, were it a planet I found naturally (and not a gas giant), would've been extraordinary - but since it's your introduction to gas giants, I just kept getting reminded about the fact that this *isn't* at all what I was expecting from this content. It's just a dangerous planet you walk around on like any other.

I don't mind cozy games, like Stardew Valley. Not every game needs to be action packed, skill based, competitive, etc.

This game has come an amazingly long way since launch! Kudos to the developer for coming through on their promise and fixing alot of the missed promises that the game had been missing when it came out. 

However, that doesn't mean its fun. I put eleven hour into the game and could not be bothered to enjoy any of it.. i tried in both PC and PCVR, and couldnt get into the game.. I love Sci Fi games, Open World, Exploring, Survival, Building, Space Combat... it checks all those boxes.. but there are games out there that do  them all better with less complication.

There is alot of endgame things I didnt get to experiance in my 11 hours, however, If I dont like the games core, why would I push to the endgame. They have a good concept here and continue to push out content, plenty of people do and will like this game.. I am just not one of them. I will swing back by in a year or so and see what changes future updates bring to the table.

Combat is a good evolution of the older Spider-man 2 PS2 game, as well as the web swinging. Story is new, and top notch, with a great cast to boot that knocks it out of the park. 

There are far better reviewers out there that have gone through this game, and I cant do it justice compared to them.

I love Spider-Man as much as the next guy, really. And web-swinging through New York City feels fantastic.
The bosses, the cinematic moments, and the flow of the main missions? All superb.

But the open world is grossly underutilized. The activities, side missions, and exploration are just bare-minimum filler—not worth anyone’s time.
Combat is satisfying at first, but it quickly loses steam, becoming a shallow means to an end. The same goes for stealth—just something you have to slog through to get to the good parts.

The story surrounding Peter and the supporting characters is okay—a little generic and predictable. I never felt much real tension or stakes throughout, and then it ended on what should have been an emotionally charged moment, but it just didn’t land.

I’m a little surprised this was held in such high regard. Maybe it’s the brand or the exclusivity that inflated its reputation, or maybe it’s just me.

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Nearly a decade since the tragedy that started his career in colourful tights, Peter Parker is still struggling with being an otherwise ordinary person in extraordinary circumstances. The city that never sleeps is full of many opportunities, but Parker never takes the easy way out. For all of his incredible strength and spider sense, he is ultimately forced to realize that, if not for his wall-crawling abilities, taking the higher moral ground would have him slipping off the edge. 

Spider-Man is very much so the greatest hero in all of capeslop. Why is it that Spider-Man, despite having all the DNA to potentially be cringe but always escapes the accusations? Largely, it is because Spider-Man is simply that good at what he is meant to be.

While the Batman Arkham games pioneered being actually good, semi-open world hero games and are still a gold standard for what a game should be, there is something I have to admit. Now, don't get me wrong, Batman is the king of DC as far as I am concerned and he surpasses that of even Superman. However, Batman's place is augmented heavily by his rogue gallery. Batman has the greatest villains in comics and turn, they elevate Batman to one of the greatest heroes of comics. 

But why doesn't he stand toe to toe to his nearest peer, who just gets the edge on him a little bit? Largely it is because while Spider-Man has an equally iconic rogue gallery, Spider-Man himself steals the show from them. Which is why when this game throws some of the villains at us without much needed development, it is hard to be too upset about it. After all, this is a Spider-Man game and we haven't had a Spider-Man game this good since the famous Spider-Man 2 on PS2 and Ultimate Spider-Man.

The webhead stands as the most human of heroes in a sea of stoic anti-heroes. He has his moments, but his vulnerability, occasional angst and life-like circumstances make him far more relatable than Batman ever could be. Batman is such a strong character, because his villains often complement or contrast with worse parts of himself and who he could become. Spider-Man is such a strong character because he is more like all of us, rather than any fictional villain.

I disagree with Bill's rant in Kill Bill Volume 2, Spider-Man is the one who actually is the person and Peter Parker is the costume. Spider-Man is the embodiment of all the moral integrity and moral obligation that power comes with, Peter Parker is the anchor of humility that keeps Peter human. Whereas Clark Kent is the persona of a God-like man's idea of a defenseless creature, a spineless, nerdy journalist - Spider-Man is the embodiment of everything that is good of people. Because Spider-Man is the product of his upbringing, his overcoming of a terrible tragedy, he is not a critique or a mask - he is the heart inherited from Uncle Ben, from the selflessness of Aunt May and others. 

And this game really gets that. Mechanically, it is a spectacular action game that can be boring if you let it be, but has a lot of room for creative combos and exploration of the shockingly huge and well rendered New York City, which of course, is perpetually still an awful place to be. Great landmarks! But even Spidey finds himself evicted.

The only thing that really holds this game back is that the side content is entirely slop. There are a few objectives I can recommend solely for the peak dialogue and lore insight they provide (the backpacks, Black Cat stakeouts and the art-recovery in The Heist DLC), but the side missions and side content in this game are the sloppiest I've ever seen since Assassin's Creed 3. The best part though, is that even though you are greatly encouraged or even blackmailed into trying this slop, you literally can swing away.

When this game lets you just be Peter or Spider-Man, it's one of the greatest of its class. Absolutely phenomenal. 

That is why the MJ and Miles missions can be so insufferable. Yes, MJ (at least in the first two thirds of the story) is an insufferably written self-insert of one of the writers and has absolutely dogshit missions that destroy the speedy pace of the story. Every time a MJ mission started or she made some nonsensical comments, I would role my eyes audibly and groan. It has nothing to do with MJ, being a woman in an empowered role, it has entirely to do with the fact that she's vanilla, her motivations are entirely incorrect and stupid and her arguments with Peter are antagonistic in the worst way. When she's a support character later in the DLCs and actually explains herself a bit, she is far more tolerable.

Miles, however, is pretty great. His missions sort of suck shit too, but they are far shorter and sweeter. Sony does what the comics could not, make Miles an actual interesting character who you don't mind becoming a near-peer to Peter.  Spiderverse just firmly reasserts the fact that Miles' lackluster comic run is entirely the fault of his early writers and that his potential for a character is unlimited when given someone competent writing his direction.

MJ does have one great mission, that should have frankly been her only one, where she investigates Norman Osborne. Despite Norman spending not a lot of time in the game, it was fun seeing how he's a far more realistic depiction of a disgruntled billionaire with defense contract than Batman is.

These sections are not awful as much as they are just so slow compared to playing Spider-Man and frankly, everything MJ does in the story, Spider-Man could do 100x faster, safer, more efficiently and it just makes you wonder why MJ is here at all, other than adhering to the infamous Status Quo of Spider-Man stories that still holds are favourite webslinger back time to time. 

Luckily, MJ is far from the only lady in the game, its just a shame that all the others ones are written so much better. Black Cat and Spidey have amazing synergy and proves that the game can have fun stealth missions after all. And well, Silver Sable is in the game too. Enough said. Both of these white-haired characters have more depth and intrigue than MJ ever has. 

Even Yuriko Watanabe has a sizable role in the game. With a female cast this strong, it really makes you wonder why MJ is here at all, when every other character can do what she does so much better and with more flair. 

That aside, this game is an absolute treat for Spidey fans. It really is worth the hype and the remaster has painted this already visually stunning game into a light that makes you forget it came out in 2018. There is a great amount of polish, some superb voice acting and frankly, all the things that prevent it from being perfect, just make you more excited the minute you are back behind the webshooters in the city.

2/10 side content, with a 9/10 story that succeeds infinitely more than it stumbles. A huge treat for even casual fans, but also a lot of love to the very interesting Superior Spider-Man storylines from awhile ago. Doc Ock fans are eating so good in this game, fr fr.

Would have liked some licensed music here and there more often, to be honest, just to give more of a vibe to New York City that is obnoxiously quiet besides the constant bustle of fully automatic gunfire, fucking rockets and whatever non-sense that blows up on the Central Station streets more often than it should.

There is not enough room in these reviews to genuinely put down everything they did right. Despite my complaints above, Sony did a solid by finally putting this on PC. A game of this caliber truly does not deserve to be stuck on the no-games console forever and hopefully, this trend of former Playstation exclusives coming to steam continues.

Some of the character dynamics they pull through here, really put some of the comics and cartoons to shame. I don't follow Spidey or much hero stuff nearly as much as I used to, but this game really brought back the kind of nostalgia that defined my entire generation.

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,This is better than the second spider-man game... the second one has you exploiting children in the beginning of the game.,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"You've gotta give it up for the tripple As if they're actually good. This game looks beautiful and plays ultra smooth. I couldn't believe how optimized it was. Stable, high framerates and very short loading times. Many other premium products could learn a lot from this game.
It gave me so many flashbacks to the Nintendo Gamecube Spiderman. I loved swinging around the city in that game and this one made me feel the same.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Great game, good graphics (if your computer can handle it), and great story. The game provides different styles of gameplay, so you can use stealth or go headfirst into a room full of enemies. There's also a lot of fun minigames and challenges to last you hours. The game is also well-balanced, so if you're not good at one aspect of the game (like the speed rounds) you won't get frustrated having to repeat the same scene over and over. Or, I should say it doesn't happen very often. I got stuck repeating one scene at Oscorp a million times before I lucked out and got past it. That being said, I would still recommend buying the game.",True,Strategy

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"amazing graphics, small bugs, over complicated control, but a good game overall, does get repetitive after a few hours",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Played this on PS4 first and got platinum, did it again on PC. Great game! Cool abilities, suits, and bosses.

I don't know why, but the web swinging in this is kinda addicting...

Not a big fan of the MJ or Miles sections, but I guess they needed to do some exposition and character development somehow. Pro tip: equip the suit mod that makes enemies take longer to detect you, I think it works for the MJ / Miles sections -- the AI are kinda dummy.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"This is probably the best superhero game I've ever played, and it's certainly the best Spider-Man game I've played. There are some annoying tidbits here and there, like the repetitiveness of the crimes in the game, but those are far outshined by the awesome combat system, near flawless web swinging, and the surprisingly great story.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"After completing the whole story with aldd additional campains, I can say that it is worth to play.
Fresh and good graphics, great optimisation and seeamless controll makes gameplay a great thing.
Story line is good too, interesting to watch and go through all main missions.
As a result it was a great hours of playing, especially great was full experience with dualsense features, which made this game even more immersive. Recommend to play if you haven't, you will not regret it.

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,Absolutely amazing game. Great combat and story.,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,This game is absolute peak the movement when it comes to swinging is great. The combat is amazing as well as all the unique options for moves and skills are great. I really enjoyed all the suits and the power ups that came with them. Also all the side missions are engaging and never get boring. Totally recommend this game if you want a fun time and enjoy spiderman.,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"10/10. The webswinging is amazing, the storyline is genuinely interesting and had me invested with the ending being absolutely spectacular. Combat has a lot of depth, there's tons of moves and it can be a little challenging when you first start but it feels awesome once you get the hang of it. There's also 3 completely free dlc which are great. I don't usually 100% games but this ones just that good.",True,Strategy

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Story was great, side quest were fun, the fighting does get a little repetitive but it was a great game. 85/100",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Never have I played a game like this. Imma be cliche here and say what everyone always says cause its true man, this game makes you FEEL like Spider-man. I think its absolutely worth any amount of money just to experience this game once. Truly a spectacular game.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"I've already played this game to completion on release of the PS4.

This a good game to unwind and play when you've got nothing to do. The story is good, the characters are well rounded and fun to watch, the combat is not super detailed but has enough depth to make things fun. It's another one of those ""clear all the objectives on the map"" style games, but you play as Spiderman.

I'd get it on a sale, but again, i've played it to death once before, now its a good game to play with something on in the background.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Love every Spiderman game, the game is a *little* wonky when it comes to some of the swinging and combat mechanics, but I got obsessed with it like I usually do with Marvel games.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"this game is very fun and it can be a little hard sometimes but i like shooting webs at the fisk thugs and demons, my only complaint is the high price (its pretty reasonable for the content) and high storage (but you cant really control that)",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"good port, good game, good buy.
maybe wait for it to go on sale though? it is a 7 year old game that goes for 60 dollars retail, which i guess is playstation's entire point when it comes to pc (old playstation studios games sell for retail price, when you can pick them up for the original console at a store for dirt cheap.) but still, incredible game nonetheless.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"This is probably the best iteration of a spider man game I ever played. I did not play it originally on PS5 so this is my first time playing. The combat is super fun and you feel agile and powerful. The boss fights are a lot of fun as well. Each boss you fight is designed perfectly to fit the theme of the character from the comics/movies. NYC looks stunning on PC. Overall the game ran really good on my PC, there were a few crashes here and there, but thankfully it's easy to pop back into where you were left off at. 

What really surprised me is the story. At first it felt like a pretty generic super hero story, but as you get into act 2 and act 3 of the game the emotion the characters and voice actors bring really hits. I was not expecting to tear up a bit at the end. I highly recommend getting this game.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,Best single player story line game that I have ever played. I am so glad that this was remastered and made available on PC.,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Amazing story line, wish it could be longer but its still great.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"I havnt written a review yet as I just never bothered and almost never do however it needs to be said. I bought this game on the day of release on the ps4 and pre ordered it, played it non stop until it finished and then played it 3 more times at least on the ps4 version. I have then played it multiple times over on pc and ps5 and thats saying something as I almost never play through a game more than once and yet even now im gonna play through it again, this is truely one of the best games out there for people that love superhero character and the story is absolutely fantastic, the boss battles are so god damn fun and the emotional scenes and the weight you feel playing through some parts of the game are so immersive its absolutely insane and much MUCH better than the new spiderman 2 game which is lacking in pretty much everything. 

This game felt so grounded, it had some crazy cool scenes, I actually enjoyed the stealth mission with miles as it makes you feel powerless in comparison to the rhino but the MJ missions on both games are horrid and I wish those didnt exist. I loved the miles morales game as well so if you havnt played that I would recommend it but it is a short game so try and get it cheap if possible.

Overall this in my opinion is one of if not the best games ive played and nothing so far has come close to it for me as you are so absorbed into the story, the risks, the heartbreak, the feeling of swinging around the city and not flying around it like superman, the set pieces, literally everything is perfect and I dont understand why they werent able to reach the same level of greatness in the second game which hurt me so bad playing it but this game is an absolute MUST BUY!",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,The closest you'll ever feel to actually being Spider-Man until an official VR game is made,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,after playing this game for 44 hours and getting all achievements i can say without a doubt this is one of if not the best spider-man games insomniac ever made,True,Strategy

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Very well made game.
The story is outstanding along with the gameplay.
The gameplay is smooth and very enjoyable.
I loved the web swinging in this game, easily my fav part of the game.
",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Marvel`s Spider-Man is absolutely magnificent game . The characters are so well done and the Spider-man is so well done and full of charm and funny Spidey quips, just like in comics or movies. The story goes hard and it gets serious when it has to, and the ending is epic . The movement, swinging, crawling on the walls is all really well done and I have absolutely loved just exploring this rich world of Manhattan, with side stories being quite good too. It takes around 19 hours for the main story. There is plenty unlockables to, like costumes and gadgets. The only downside I can point out is the annoying and repetitive mini-puzzles, I think they are cheap and boring, but other than that no complaints. 
Would I recommend Spider-Man in 2025 ? Absolutely ! This is how games should be done !
9.9/10",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,very good game and enjoyed every second of it minus the sable outposts >:(. I like how you get a good couple hours of extra content with the dlcs too FOR FREE.

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"As someone who never got to play the Spiderman games since like 2005, I loved this game. the suits are cool and funny..? But it definitely got me fired up for the others, miles morales and spiderman 2 that just released on PC",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"With Great Power and Great Responsibility, there's also a Amazing, Astonishing, Spectacular Spider-Man game. Story so good it made me want to re immerse myself into the Spider-Man's world and characters and oh my god I just want more out of this game. The gameplay is Astonishing and Spectacular and the web swinging is the second best web swinging I've played in sany Spider-Man game(until Insomniac released Spider-Man 2). My only critic about the gameplay is that I feel like some gadgets feel out of place for Spider-Man and some make combat waaaaay too easy. Photo mode is amazing for those that like getting into taking pictures (I had way too much fun with it at random points). This is a 9/10 game from me, if you haven't experienced this game I say play it now...it also makes you feel like Spider-man. (totally a original thing to say)",True,Strategy

",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Really cool game. Definitely brings being spiderman to life with a very realistic looking NYC. Looks close to the real thing with the landmarks.
The game is pretty easy. Spiderman is painfully too nice. There are times where you play people other than spiderman where you have to sneak that I don't care for, which reduces its replay value.
I probably won't play it again, but this game offers an experience you won't get anywhere else.
Seems to be closer to the original spiderman than the newer ones which I enjoyed, but it really is a mix of them all.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Amazing story, graphics, atmosphere it's all amazing. Sure it crashes every 3-4 hours but common that's a lot of play time before the crash. Overall amazing game 10/10 would recommend.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,This game is so fun that I 100% it twice while still forgetting how many awful forced-stealth missions the main story has,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Too good of a game, an absolute banger! Enjoyed it too much and finished it 100%. A must play!",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,Very enjoyable game. Swinging around Manhattan is such a blast. One of the few examples where traversal in an open world game is actually fun.,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"10/10, I never try to 100% a game, it seems like more work and time than I'm willing to commit normally. But THIS game has me doing any and every side quests and the story is great. Collecting the suits is awesome but mixing and matching the powers and suit add-ons make for really diverse playstyle options. One of the greatest things I enjoy is the game just seems endless. You can stay in one spot or wander but crimes WILL pop up, you don't have to do them but you're Spider-man. Why WOULDN'T you??!!",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,It's an amazing game. Ton of fun and well made. I had some crashes but overall it's a solid experience!,True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,The Remastered for this game is very underrated in my opinion. It makes the game so much better graphic wise and it has that new face showing Peter that he's still young but Knowledgeable as both Peter and Spider-Man. The story is amazing as always and the combat feels great. I feel like they put too much crimes in the game but I understand for it to not get too stale when you're waiting for the next missions if you plan on getting everything done before continuing on the main story. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy Story games more than multiplayer games but if you need a break from multiplayer games this is a great relief from pvp.,True,Strategy

How the story is told tying everyone into the mix of it all was quite fun to watch it all play out. The major combat/fight scenes were fun the play [such as fighting the main villains]. This is quite the excellent build up for the new Spider Man 2. The DLC included in this series are true to the stroy and give you a couple more hours of gameplay depending on how you approach them. 
I don't really have any complaints with the game. Clearly, I've completed it so I enjoyed what I was playing. HOWEVER, the only thing I have to complain about is the Screwball challenges. I won't spoil anything for those who have yet to play, but those challenges were very infuriating just to collect an achievement. 
Overall, the game was a nice addition to the Spider Man series and if you are looking for just a good old time swinging around with your friendly neighborhood spiderman with a great story to boot then this is the game for you!",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"A revolutionary installment in the Spider-Man gaming scene. This game takes every element from it's predecessors, the web-zipping from Amazing Spider-Man, the webs attaching to the buildings around you, the amazing combat built off of Edge of Time and Web of Shadows, and the amazing open world. It has one of the best original Spider-Man stories, and the suit selection is immaculate. This truly is the definitive Spider-Man experience.",True,Strategy

Insomniac and created a masterpiece and I enjoyed this game till the end.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"A good game with good game play. The ""MJ"" missions weren't as bad as was said, in that game wise they are fine, it's just that MJ is rather whiny. The final act was a nice conclusion of the game, so hold on if you find act I and II a bit repetitive.",True,Strategy
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"The best Spidey story in any form of media - beats all movies, TV shows, and even comics, I'll die on that hill. Also the best Spidey game that I've personally played, and yes that does include the Atari 2600 Spider-Man.

Stardew Valley,"Hello

I can say that Stardew Valley was one of the best farming games I've ever played

This game is more than a farming game, it's real life

Planting crops in different seasons is very interesting, as well as the rotation of seasons and...

Having animals is really beautiful and adds beauty to the game

The most interesting thing is that you can get married and have children (that's why I say it's more than a normal game)

Each character has their own story and some of them are really dark

You should definitely buy this game and play it",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"Stardew is a game I keep finding myself coming back to. The dev continues to deliver great, hefty updates full of new content to explore. And the mod-ability is practically endless.

Words cannot do this game justice, and this will likely be lost in the sea of recommendations, but if you want a quaint, fun, adorable little game to dump time into, look no further.",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"If you haven't played Stardew Valley yet, do yourself a favor and download it now.
It is a solid game, with rich story and lore, and many game elements that allow you to make it your own. Don't care for farming, but love fishing? Play a fishing-heavy play-through. Not much on combat? Focus on other aspects of the game.
Then, in addition, this game has a deep modding community that really let's this game become yours. Not to mention the fandom community, playability with a controller, a thriving Youtube fanbase, and ongoing support from its developer, Concerned Ape.",True,Strategy

Very sad because i supposed to recommend this game because of its comfiness and mod support",False,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"Cozy vibes for casual gamers with a surprising amount of depth for the non-casual players; challenge comes in the form of uncovering secrets, mini games (like the fishing mechanic for legendary and rare fish), and scouring for rare materials to complete quests and longer in-game objectives. While the solo experience is fun, having at least 1 extra hand in a multiplayer game makes your days feel more productive. Easy to get sucked into for HOURS.",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,this like a second contender to skyrim for me this game is crazy i love it i love spending so much time on this game i married haley the blonde chick idc if ima girl she def gotta be gay. love that you can play this either solo or with other people. love stardew fr fr,True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,This game is amazing but it makes you want to all of a sudden make your room a nature design and be productive which scares me but also you can annoy people in this game so of course its a amazing game,True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"One of my most played games. I own it on several platforms so that I can play it with basically anyone, or play it basically anywhere. I keep coming back, even if there are months where I don't play it, because every time I start up a new farm with a new farmer, it gets its hooks in me and I can't even sleep without thinking about this game. I will probably play this game for a great many more years to come. Multiplayer is probably also the best thing to happen to Stardew. Cannot recommend this game enough (yes, even the fishing).",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,It's a really nice game that's got a lot of different elements and never gets boring despite being just incredibly benevolent and wholesome,True,Strategy

Stardew Valley,"I never seem to be able to finish this game. I always find myself restarting my file.
All the events and characters are so diverse and cute, it's satisfying to get to know them as we play.
One thing I hate about this game is THE DAMN SKULL CAVERN (Bless you who made the skull cavern elevator mod)

Bonus point for all the modders out there, thank you for making my emo man Sebastian looks not so emo <3
I might spend the rest of my life playing stardew and restarting over and over again to marry all characters...
So excited :>",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"This game is super fun, never truly feels repetitive. Probably the game I have most hours on aside from Minecraft or something on my Wii, like -- Mario Party 7, or something. 

Characters are fun, the art is honestly really pretty. I love Krobus, and my dogs. Shallow enough for wiggle room, I wish there was more dialogue honestly. But it is still hype.

I will say, the wiki is your friend, it is super hard to really get what you need without actually knowing what to do. Don't be afraid to craft, I am, for some reason. Also, don't listen to 100% people who try to force you to maxmize in every way. Have fun unless you want to 100%.

Multiplayer sucks unless you have more than two players. That is also a thing.",True,Strategy

Stardew Valley,"Game to escape the woes of modern capitalist society and join an actual community plus farm. 

However after first year you try to min max profit and try to be as efficient as possible. The townfolk never see you as you're too busy tending to live stock and making starfruit wine. You are stuck in an endless loop of trying to increase your wealth and realize you're just another cog in the capitalist machine.

Stardew Valley,"Reasons to buy Stardew Valley

1. Story
You inherit a farm plot from your grandpa in a small town called ""Pelican Town"". After working a dead-end job, you decide to move into Pelican Town.

2. Characters
In Pelican Town there are 34 unique villagers that you can make friends with. You can even form a relationship with some of the villagers (watch out, it will not end good if you romance more than one person).

3. Gameplay
Its a farming game where you plant and harvest crops, but you can do other stuff like fishing and mining in caves. It is addictive to say at least.

4. Sountrack and Graphics
Masterpiece. The soundtrack and graphics look like a hidden SNES gem. It reminds me of Harvest Moon a little bit.

5. Conclusion
Masterpiece and an excellent passion project that is a must buy. You can even play it with up to 8 players in the same village. 10/10",True,Strategy

There was  a lot of care that went into creating this game.",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"game is so cute, cosy and fun! some issues with multiplayer but otherwise great.",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"Very fun sandbox farming game, even better due to its robust modding scene. I do not like recommending a game based on its mods, because I think a good game should be able to stand on its own, which stardew valley very much can, and does! But if you're thinking of buying it, it's modding scene is great.",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"Its so addicting I LOVE IT.  Just be prepared that you will be consumed and the time will fly. You have many options to choose from.

Stardew Valley,"This game has a lot of charm. Just like the Dev, I always wanted a good sequel to Harvest Moon, and this game surpasses any attempt ever made to bring that to reality. Not only that, but he's still updating and adding content after all these years. No additional DLC's either, just continually making the game even better.

We love you Concerned Ape! You give us hope for the future of gaming. Your integrity and commitment is an inspiration!

Highly Recommended ^^

Edit: After asking some questions and seeking knowledge about the game on the steam discussion board, the response by the moderator feels snippy and toxic. The moderator then locks the discussion, because the original thread was a few years old...

If the information is still relevant and people are seeking knowledge, why wouldn't you encourage players to learn more and answer the questions? Why lock the thread? By that logic, none of us should study history or try to learn from others who have more experience.

If you want to seek more information and learn about the game, I recommend to just go on YouTube. The moderator on the steam discussion board has terrible behavior. I will never bother with that again.",True,Strategy

Stardew Valley,"Amazing! The love and attention that ConcernedApe has poured into this game truly shows. And he's not even done! Still adding content, years later, not asking for additional funds, this is a man's lifes work. He deserves every single penny of every single copy of this game that has sold.

Fishing can be a bit nasty early on, but once you get the hang of it, it tightens up. Combat, mining, farming, relationships, multiplayer, this game has a LOT going for it. Let the innumerable positive reviews do the talking!",True,Strategy
Stardew Valley,"It is truly impressive how with just a few mods you can turn a game about living on and running a farm in a small farming community, to living on and running a farm in a modern day sodom and gomorrah!

Stardew Valley,"This game is undeniable proof that story/gameplay beats graphics EVERY TIME, at least for me!

I love this game. It is so much fun and there's so much to do. I love it so much it's the only game I've ever added (time)mods for just so I could enjoy each day in it longer. I even got my parents to try it on Switch(they liked it too, but got frustrated by the speed of the days as well lol)

Stardew Valley,"Title: A Heartwarming, Addictive Farming Adventure - Stardew Valley Review

Stardew Valley is a true gem in the world of indie games, and it’s easy to see why it has captured the hearts of so many players, including myself. This charming farming simulator offers so much more than meets the eye, blending relaxing gameplay with a surprisingly deep and rewarding experience. I couldn’t put it down from the moment I started.

Gameplay and Mechanics: The game’s premise is simple yet addictive: inherit a rundown farm and transform it into something beautiful. But it’s the sheer variety of activities you can do that kept me coming back day after day. From planting crops, fishing, and raising animals to mining, crafting, and even building relationships with the townspeople, there’s always something to do. What I love most is how the game strikes the perfect balance between hard work and rewards — planting a crop and watching it grow, selling produce, or upgrading your farm feels so satisfying.

The daily rhythm of the game is incredibly relaxing but still offers a sense of accomplishment as you see your farm flourish. The seasons changing and the activities that come with them (like festivals, foraging, or the different crops) keep the game feeling fresh, no matter how many hours you put in.

Characters and Story: While Stardew Valley isn’t focused on a single narrative, the game’s strength lies in the town’s colorful cast of characters. Getting to know each of the villagers, building friendships (or even romancing them), and seeing how their lives unfold over time added a personal and meaningful touch to the game. I found myself looking forward to my interactions with them every day, as each character has their own quirks, backstory, and motivations.

Customization and Progression: One of the best parts of Stardew Valley is the sense of progression and customization. From designing your farm layout to choosing how to spend your time, every decision feels meaningful. The farming improvements and new areas to unlock give a sense of growth, and I loved seeing how my hard work paid off in the form of new abilities, tools, and opportunities.

Soundtrack and Atmosphere: The soothing soundtrack fits the game perfectly and adds to the overall sense of calm. The music sets the mood for each season and event, enhancing the experience. Whether I was working on my crops, exploring the mines, or simply relaxing at the local pub, the soundtrack never failed to immerse me in the world.

Overall Experience: Stardew Valley is a wonderfully wholesome experience that I recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing yet rewarding game. Whether you’re into farming sims or just want a game to get lost in, it’s a beautiful world that’s hard to leave once you’ve stepped inside. The attention to detail, the loveable characters, and the sense of community make it a must-play. It’s a game that allows you to play at your own pace, yet always feels engaging and rewarding.

If you haven’t tried it yet, do yourself a favor and start your own adventure in Stardew Valley — you won’t regret it.

It is a soothing relaxed game that I have played through many times. It ""ends"" after 2 years game time though you can continue with the save as long as you want (I think).

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Grand Theft Auto V – Great Game, But Not Without Issues

GTA V offers an amazing single-player experience with a well-written story, fun missions, and a detailed open world. The gameplay is smooth, and Los Santos feels alive with plenty to do.

GTA Online has tons of content, but it's heavily grindy, filled with toxic players using Oppressor Mk IIs, and plagued with cheaters and modders, especially on PC. Bugs and connection issues are still common, and loading times remain frustratingly long. Rockstar’s focus on microtransactions also hurts the experience.

The single-player is worth it, but GTA Online can be frustrating unless you play with friends.",True,Strategy

Online co-op should have a separate achievement list --- it is a complete mess, endless waiting in loading screens, and too many failed missions because the team quits. No back fill or bots, no distribution of money when crewmates leave heists.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"The game introduced kernel level anti-cheat with the 1.69 update, which is fine but the company is LYING about Steam Deck/Linux not supporting BattlEye, as Valve has already worked with BattlEye and EAC to provide support for Linux on these anticheats, the company also lied about the games never being officially supported on the Steam Deck/Linux as the verified badge was on the game before the BattlEye update and the company never claimed the badge wasn't official, the AC was also bypassed within days by an open source program that Rockstar illegally took down, but the dev wasn't willing to fight back, this company is a lying piece of shit, that only cares about profits, not players, their only objective is to milk this game's shitty online and screw over anyone who even dares to not play by their rules, even Expanded & Enhanced took 3 unecessary years to be released on PC simply because they couldn't resell the game to PC players like they could to console players because we aren't fucking stupid.",False,Strategy
Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"I must give it negative review since GTA Online has become unplayable on Linux cause of anticheat. I know this game was not made for Linux in the first place, but since it worked in Linux for all this time, I invested time in GTA Online only to be kick out by anticheat.

GTA singleplayer is still playable, but I doubt I would be replaying sp in the future. SP story is fun, critical of current day US, a bit of a snapshot of current life over there.

GTA online is a bit too grindy for my taste, but I guess they have to make you want to buy those sharkcards. Interesting thing is that in online, ingame characters call you to advertise sharkcards or other things that they think could bring more money. At first it's fun, until you realise they will do these calls every time you enter the game. That is no fun, and is tiring. You will answer the call even if you do not want to. And if you stop the call, you will cause them to call you even more.
I like recently added taxi missions in online. I do not like that you can not fix your taxi car as mission goes on. Also you can not modify that car in any way. There is some black and red version that you can pay a lot of $ or win it in the arena. At the moment, you can only $ (in game c), as arena is basically dead, nobody plays it. I do not know what mods can you make to that car, I tried to get it just so I could modify it.",False,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Ever since I was a kid, GTA V has been more than just a game to me. It’s a part of my gaming soul. From the first time I set foot in Los Santos, I was completely hooked. The massive open world, the freedom to do whatever I wanted, and the unforgettable story made it an experience like no other.  
Even after all these years, my love for GTA V hasn’t faded. Whether I’m causing chaos in the city, racing through the streets, or just messing around with friends in GTA Online, the game never stops being fun. The memories I’ve made such as: Epic heists, Hilarious fails, and ""Insane stunts"" :D are moments I’ll never forget.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"After all this time bro :(
One of my favourite games of all time, as a Linux user I can no longer play is because after 10 years they have decided to downgrade to a kernel-level anticheat which blocks Linux by design. Making it, inverse from the past, one of actually very few games these days that doesn't run on Linux.
Such a shame. I hope they're not doing this for GTA6 as well, or I'll never get to play it. GTA has always been a good franchise but I'm not switching back to Windows just to play it. Sorry Rockstar, it's been a good run.",False,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Story and Characters:
While the three protagonists are interesting, the overall story feels disjointed and lacks the emotional depth of previous GTA titles like GTA IV. The satire and humor, while entertaining, can feel over-the-top and repetitive, making it hard to connect with the narrative.

Mission Design:
Many missions follow a similar formula: drive somewhere, shoot enemies, and escape. While there are standout heist missions, a lot of the gameplay can feel repetitive, especially for players who aren’t fans of open-world fetch quests.

Controls and Mechanics:
The controls, particularly for shooting and driving, can feel clunky and outdated compared to more modern games. The cover system is serviceable but not as smooth as in dedicated shooters.

Conclusion:
Grand Theft Auto V is a well-crafted game with a lot to offer, but it might not live up to the hype for everyone. Its open world and production values are impressive, but the repetitive mission design, lack of innovation, and shallow story can make it feel like an average experience. For players seeking a deep, narrative-driven game or groundbreaking gameplay, GTA V might fall short. However, for those who enjoy sandbox-style chaos and multiplayer shenanigans, it’s still a solid choice.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Story and Characters: Three dudes – a grumpy old geezer, a total psycho biker dude, and a young hustler – pull off bank jobs and cause absolute mayhem.  Think Ocean's Eleven but way more bonkers. The plot's a rollercoaster, the characters are off-the-wall nuts, and the lines are funnier than a barrel of monkeys.
 
Gameplay and Open World: Los Santos is a giant playground – steal cars, mess with NPCs, and do stuff so ridiculous it's genius. Golfing? Yoga?  Yeah, why not?  Just remember to cause some serious ruckus.
 
Online Mode (GTA Online): Wanna be in a crazy car chase with 29 other lunatics? GTA Online's your jam. It's total chaos; anything goes (and usually does).  Expect epic battles, hilarious glitches, and maybe a few salty rage quits.  Unless you're rocking some serious mods, other players might try to school you.  It's a total free-for-all, so be prepared to get your butt kicked (and dish it out too!).  However, big downside:  you can't play online through Steam Deck because of that pesky anti-cheat.  Bummer, right?
 
Graphics and Sound: The graphics are still killer, even after all these years. Los Santos looks so real you'll forget you're not actually causing trouble IRL. The soundtrack is fire – the perfect tunes for all the crazy action.
 
Overall: GTA V is the bomb.com. It's hilarious and surprisingly deep, a chaotic adventure that'll keep you glued to your screen.  It would be a solid 9/10, but that Steam Deck online issue and the anti-cheat shenanigans knock it down to an 8/10. Still a must-play, though!  Seriously, go get it.",True,Strategy

I won’t be able to play anymore as I don’t want anti cheat trash on my system. No steam deck support or Linux support anymore. Single player was good. Multiplayer was always a boring grindfest full of hackers and micro transactions and somehow they’ve made that worse by adding this rootkit. Kernel level anti cheat is worse than the cheaters.

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5), developed by Rockstar Games, is an open-world action-adventure game that has remained one of the most popular and successful titles since its release in 2013. With a vast, detailed world, engaging story, and endless activities, GTA 5 continues to offer an unmatched sandbox experience.

Positive Aspects:
✅ Massive Open World – The fictional city of Los Santos is full of life, with incredible attention to detail, diverse environments, and endless opportunities for exploration.

✅ Engaging Story and Characters – The single-player campaign follows three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with unique personalities and missions, creating an engaging and cinematic experience.

✅ GTA Online Offers Endless Fun – The online multiplayer mode allows players to participate in heists, races, businesses, and more, constantly evolving with updates and new content.

✅ Variety of Gameplay Activities – Whether it’s robbing a bank, flying a jet, racing cars, or simply causing chaos, GTA 5 offers limitless freedom and activities.

✅ Modding Community (PC Version) – The game’s active modding community enhances gameplay with custom content, from realistic graphics to entirely new game modes.

Negative Aspects:
❌ GTA Online's Grind and Microtransactions – While fun, GTA Online can feel heavily monetized, pushing players toward purchasing Shark Cards to skip the long grind for in-game currency.

❌ Aging Graphics (Despite Updates) – While the game still looks good, especially with next-gen enhancements, some aspects of the visuals and animations feel dated compared to newer open-world games.

❌ Repetitive AI and Mission Structure – Some missions follow a predictable formula, and AI behavior can feel unrealistic at times, especially in police chases.

Final Verdict:
GTA 5 is one of the best open-world games ever made, offering a rich single-player experience and a constantly evolving online world. Despite some aging elements and monetization issues in GTA Online, the sheer amount of content and freedom make it a must-play for any gaming fan. 🚗💥🏙️",True,Strategy

Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,"In short,
Story mode: 
The story itself is amazing. The characters were played amazingly. The side missions are interesting. The development of the character throughout the story is logical compelling, and you really want to know what actually happened at the beginning of the story (no spoilers).
The map is not small, but most of the action is happening only in the city (same goes for online). Something I'm sure has already been considered in GTA 6, seeing what has already been leaked.
Online:
A lot of people complain about the online version of the game for different reasons. But most of the complaints can have a workaround, while others... not so much.
For those who say there are moders and hackers, I've played the game mostly in an invite only session. Which means that I had no other player in the lobby. And I only join a public lobby to get the ""High demand bonus"" and the excitement.
Other say it's too much of a grind and is pay to win. I con only assume that these players are beginners and don't really understand all the content included in the game, with all the DLCs. Although, being a person who is playing ONLY for the fun, not for the meaningless grind, I have to say that without the Kosatka, I would have definitely not have even considered playing online that much, or even buying it twice after I lost my first account.

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]PUBG – The Battle Royale That Started It All[/h1]

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★

PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

Survival & Tension: ★★★★★

Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆

While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.

Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆

KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.

Overall Verdict:

PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters.",True,Strategy

The original Battle Royale. PUBG's name will be echoed for generations as a cultural milestone that paved the way for all future BR's released to this day. What a wonderful game this was during its prime, little to no flaws in terms of performance and game mechanics. Every match is as stressful as it is rewarding. Unfortunately it just barely misses the perfect score for a few reasons. PUBG's downfall is one that should be studied by all future game developers. The reason for this downfall being BR's such as Fortnite and Apex at their peaks respectively. This wasn't because of quality or accessibility (Even though PUBG is notorious for poor performance on console.) but rather its price. PUBG did everything right, aside from removing that price tag sooner. The pride PUBG held for its lovechild was ultimately its downfall, with so many other free options, why convince friends to spend the thirty dollars on PUBG?

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"In a nutshell, this game sounds kinda boring. However, in reality, it's the closest thing to a drug addiction. I love the simple joy of just driving, the game itself, the amazing mod support, and the fantastic community!

BUT: The driving and traffic mechanics often feel dull and repetitive, missing the depth and realism that a more sophisticated AI could provide. The AI frequently fails to effectively manage traffic congestion, offering only minimal solutions, which can be quite frustrating. Implementing a smarter, more customizable AI system would significantly improve the experience. Another major drawback is the physics engine, which lacks realism and responsiveness and need some mods to fix that.

Build a trucking empire if you wish, or not. Pimp out your trucks, or not. It's all up to you.
There are tons of paid addons and mods to add maps, trucks, trailers, cars, customisable elements for your trucks etc. Mods allow you to make it harder to make money, or make the weather and road conditions tougher if you want a greater challange.

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"🇹🇷 Uzun zamandır bana keyif veren nadir oyunlardan biri olur Euro Truck Simulator 2. Oyunun şu anki hali bence gayet güzel. Tırların çeşitliliği gayet yeterli gelen güncellemelerle birlikte de yeni olan tırlar geliyor. Tır modifikasyon seçenekleri çeşitli fakat dlc almadıysanız yapacağınız modifikasyonlarınız da sınırlı oluyor maalesef. Açıkcası başlarda klavye ile oynuyordum fakat mouse'ye geçtim hem daha rahat hem biraz daha zevk veriyor tabii imkan olsa direksiyon setiyle oynayıp alacağınız zevki başka bir şey vermez. Gece 02:00 sularında arkada yavaş bir müzik (türkü vb.) şeylerle kafanızı boşaltmanıza çok yardımcı oluyor. Benim bu zamana kadar oynadığım güzel bir oyun herkese tavsiye ederim🤍




🇺🇸
Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the rare games that has given me joy for a long time. I think the current state of the game is quite good. The variety of trucks is sufficient, and new trucks are added with updates. The truck modification options are diverse, but if you don’t buy DLCs, your customization options are unfortunately limited.

At first, I used to play with a keyboard, but I switched to the mouse—it’s more comfortable and a bit more enjoyable. Of course, if you had the chance to play with a steering wheel setup, nothing could match that experience.

Driving around 2:00 AM with slow music  playing in the background really helps clear your mind. It's one of the best games I've played so far, and I highly recommend it to everyone. 🤍",True,Strategy
Euro Truck Simulator 2,"As someone who has spent countless hours exploring its roads, delivering cargo across its expansive map, and enjoying the meditative nature of the gameplay, I can confidently say that ETS2 holds a special place in my heart. However, despite my love for the game, recent developments have introduced issues that are difficult to overlook.

Before delving into the details, I must mention that this is my first-ever review on Steam. I felt compelled to share my thoughts because, while I have thoroughly enjoyed ETS2 over the years, the frustration caused by certain aspects of the game has reached a point where I believe it’s important to speak up.

The most glaring problem lies in the performance drops observed in newer DLC maps. While the visual upgrades and reworks in these areas are undoubtedly impressive, they come at a significant cost to performance. Even on systems that comfortably handle the base game and older expansions, these regions often result in frustratingly inconsistent frame rates. What makes this particularly exasperating is the fact that these issues did not exist before the reworks. The optimization—or lack thereof—seems to be an afterthought, leaving players with an experience that is at best distracting and at worst unplayable.

Adding to the frustration is the artificial intelligence (AI) of the game, which, despite years of development, remains woefully inadequate. The AI-controlled vehicles routinely demonstrate behaviour that ranges from mildly inconvenient to outright absurd. Sudden lane changes without signalling, failure to yield at intersections, and an uncanny ability to brake at the worst possible moment are just a few examples of the nonsensical antics players must contend with. While a degree of unpredictability is realistic in traffic simulations, the AI in ETS2 often feels less like a reflection of reality and more like a caricature of it.

As a devoted player, it is disheartening to see such issues persist in a title that I hold in such high regard. The developers' commitment to expanding the game’s world is commendable, but these efforts must be matched by a focus on optimization and refinement. Without addressing these problems, the experience of exploring ETS2’s beautifully crafted roads will continue to be overshadowed by technical and design shortcomings.

Euro Truck Simulator 2 deserves to shine as the definitive trucking simulator, and I truly want to see it thrive. However, until these frustrations are resolved, even the most loyal fans may find their patience wearing thin.

For a game that I have spent so much time enjoying, writing this review was not an easy decision. Yet, I hope this feedback helps highlight areas for improvement and contributes to making ETS2 the best it can be.",False,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"Way, way more enjoyable than it has any right to be.  Surely just driving goods around Europe (and beyond with mods) or the US (and beyond with mods) with American Truck Simulator cannot be this totally engaging?  Well, yes it certainly can.  It can be as chilled or frantic as you wish.  Personally I'm definitely at the chilled end.  Watch the world roll by, learn to manoeuvre a large truck and trailer.  The new driving helps with that.  Build a trucking empire if you wish, or not.  Pimp out your trucks, or not.  It's all up to you.
There are tons of paid addons and mods to add maps, trucks, trailers, cars, customisable elements for your trucks etc.  Mods allow you to make it harder to make money, or make the weather and road conditions tougher if you want a greater challange.

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"Once a classic, now an embodiment of everything I dislike about current video games.

Current state of ETS2/ATS is frustrating. I just can't enjoy those games anymore. The main gripe I have with ETS2 is the fact that this game is horrendously unoptimised. No matter how good your PC is... FPS drops, stuttering just can't stop. Various changes in commands don't help. Changing video setting doesn't help. Game engine just can't support further graphic enhancements, yet SCS blindly walks in the way of constant graphic addons, while disregarding any optimisations for the game. Of course, they are completely deaf to any feedback in that regard. Of course, any suggestions are immediately being responsed by game ""fans"" (cultists would be more appropriate) who are quickly telling you that you/your computer are the problem, not the game and its aged engine, incapable of being overrun with current amount of details.

Nextly, ETS2 and ATS are being kept alive through constant releases of new DLCs. OK, it's great to have new maps, trucks, skins, but what's that for, if you can't enjoy it as you should?

In my opinion, both ETS2 and ATS have reached their limits. It's time to move on, if SCS wants to continue with their current MO.

To sum up - horribly unoptimised game with plenty of paid DLC... Is that EA or something?

Such a shame, incredibly fun game to play. Sadly, ruined by its shortcomings and failure from developers to be aware about them.",False,Strategy

Pros:
✅ Immersive and Relaxing Gameplay – Drive across Europe, delivering cargo and enjoying the scenic routes. The game offers a realistic and peaceful trucking experience.

✅ Deep Customization – Modify your trucks with countless options, from paint jobs to engine upgrades.
✅ Engaging Economy System – Build your own trucking company, hire drivers, and expand your business empire.
✅ Great Modding Community – Tons of user-made content, including new trucks, maps, and improved graphics.
✅ Multiplayer (Convoy Mode) – Play with friends and enjoy cooperative trucking.

Cons:
❌ Slow-Paced for Some Players – If you prefer fast action, this may feel too relaxed.
❌ Repetitive at Times – Long hauls can get monotonous without variety in tasks.
❌ DLC Costs Add Up – While the base game is great, the full experience with all expansions can be expensive.",True,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"“10/10 Would Drive Again (And Again, And Again… And Crash Into My Friends)”

I bought this game thinking I’d just do a few casual deliveries. Turns out, I’ve now spent hours and hours transporting cargo across Europe, listening to podcasts, and becoming emotionally attached to my truck. My truck’s name is Sheila, and she deserves the world.

The beauty of the open road is unparalleled. I’ve gone from dodging traffic to getting lost in small villages, but I’ve also mastered the art of parallel parking (sort of). I can now pull off a perfect turn in a 40-ton vehicle. My real-life driving skills are… well, let’s just say, “evolving.”

Then I discovered TruckersMP, and it was game over. Now I’m not just dodging traffic—I’m dodging my friends, who are just as bad at driving as I am. The multiplayer chaos is like nothing else. I’ve spent hours in convoy, pretending to be a professional driver while simultaneously running my friends off the road. We’ve crashed into each other more times than I’d like to admit, but hey, that’s just the beauty of multiplayer. Who needs peaceful deliveries when you can have reckless, hilarious chaos?

Pro tip: If you crash, don’t worry—just blame the AI drivers. They’re the true enemies. They have a mission to ruin your life, one unnecessary brake at a time.

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that you dive into headfirst. If you’ve ever dreamed of being a long-haul trucker but weren’t ready for the real-life hassle, this game gives you all the thrills without the stress.

As someone who holds a truck driving license in Israel, I can say this game is a great training tool for anyone wanting to feel the intricacies of handling a large vehicle. It’s not just about driving around Europe, it’s about planning your routes, respecting traffic laws, and understanding the weight of a truck when turning. The sense of realism here is top-notch – from the sound of the engine to the feeling of heaviness on tight turns.

The game is designed in a way that keeps you engaged: from the busy highways filled with traffic to dynamic weather and day-night cycles that add to the immersion. The controls feel natural, and this sensation not only enhances the game but also serves as good practice for real life, since driving a virtual truck can be a useful experience.

Pros:
	•	Realism: You’re not just a driver, you’re a manager. Every detail on the road matters, and it adds a unique charm to the game.
	•	Maps and Locations: Travel across Europe, delivering cargo to beautiful corners of the continent. Each route feels different.
	•	Training for Real Drivers: As someone with a truck license, I can say this game is a solid practice ground for real-life driving. It helps get used to the scale and feel of handling a truck.
	•	Atmosphere: Rain, nighttime driving, long roads—everything pulls you into the life of a trucker.

Cons:
	•	Monotony: Sometimes the trips can feel repetitive, but if you enjoy slow-paced gameplay, it’s not a dealbreaker.
	•	Graphics: While the game looks great for a simulator, you may notice some outdated textures on distant objects.

Final Verdict: 9/10 – Not just a simulator, but a true experience that combines real-life training with an immersive journey across Europe. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to step into the shoes of a trucker and enjoys laid-back but engaging gameplay.",True,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"I have only just started playing this game as i'm relatively new to PC gaming. So far this is up there with the best game I have purchased and I already have a lot of games. Surprisingly this is a 10 year old game, I say that because to me it doesn't feel that old as the graphics are amazing on my desktop PC at full performance

My eagerness to build up my money to own my own business and hire my own drivers are pushing me forward in the game, I am also so determined to own my own truck and drive around the map exploring. But I feel this will take some time and will require doing a lot of quick jobs. 

My only annoyance is that all locations are not unlocked such as the dealership locations, it's only a personal preference thing as IRL we just use google or look at market ads. Who drives around trying to find places we don't know exist these days? 

I love the weather effects, I wish there was mist and fog though as I feel that's missing from the game. I love that the rain appears on the windows and washes away with the wipers, take note here Giants (Farming Sim), it's a small thing but it makes such a difference. It's relaxing to play, once you have got the setting adjusted to how you like to play. I removed the road blocks as I got stuck where I could only reverse down a one way road and then the police penalised me. Like what the heck was I to do? 

I am pleased to see the developers expanding this game further and they are clearly a very talented team, but I agree with others that the UK map needs updating urgently. It does feel outdated and I hope is at the top of the to-do list.

-Lots of killers from classic horror films.
-Lots of perks and an enjoyable game when people play fair.
-Lots of chapters released.

The Bad:

1) Matchmaking is horrible.
2) Lots of cheaters and exploits (both survivors and killers). Here are some:

>End game collapse occurs (you are a killer) and survivor (last one) does not die when the timer hits zero keeping you locked in the game endlessly unless you exit the game and get penalized (you are held hostage).

>Survivors do not die once hooked for the 3rd time and fall off the hook (basically an immortal survivor).  

3) Developers don't seem to care about people being able to cheat.

4) Long hours needed to grind to unlock survivors, killers, and perks.

5) Play and know that no matter how good you are, you will be  matched with poorly skilled players.

If you play solo, queue killer - although it becomes repetitive and boring and doesn't really have much charm to it/loses its charm very very quickly. the chances of winning solo queue survivor is not likely at all. there a LOT of things they could do to balance the game but it will never happen.

Dead by Daylight,"This is the game that people hate to love.

The gameplay devs are clearly the most deadweight people at Behavior.

There's also lots of cosmetic options in simple categories and the season pass has interesting rewards even in the free path.

Unfortunately then you have whoever's in charge of actually designing the gameplay elements, who I assume is led by a liberal arts major dropout. They intentionally keep things poorly balanced, keeping some killers just indefinitely weak, perks weak, different maps lopsided to favor survivors or killers, the experience as a frustration simulator, make nonsensical nerfs, have almost no transparency, no protection against hackers, exploitable mechanics, no plans to retroactively improve older killers or their Mori (execution moves), challenges that actively encourage throwing matches, predatory in-game micro-transactions where sales cost more than just buying chapters on steam, a janky leveling system that's as frustrating as the gameplay, slow progression, a mobile version that was an improvement over the standard version you can buy here but they'll never implement any of the liked features from that, and the sad part is that it's in its currently best state in years according to veteran players.

Dead by Daylight,"I really enjoyed playing this game, but...
The devs constantly kill the fun in the game. Survivors can still give up on the hook. ""Burden"" is a perk for some reason, not a game mechanic. So you have to use it in your games, like all the anti-tunnel perks, to not tilt for obvious reasons. So you can't play with other perks because there are only 4 perk slots. So there is no argument that they are adding all this to the game to fix this. No. You have to sacrifice your fun in perks to have quality of life in the game. The devs look at the numbers and don't really listen to the people who are actually playing their game. So they think solo queue is okay. But in reality it is a PAIN. This is why people stop playing your game. Because there is almost nothing you can fix to make it balanced and FUN. Who cares what new perks you bring if all that matters is gens (the main goal of the game) and chases. You need to design your game around BUILDS. So it will be fun to theory craft in the game. But you can't really think about builds because your game designer doesn't play the game! And if players find interesting and fun builds - you nerf them! That's why you kill the fun!
For example: I found a build with dh-saboteur-mom-breakout. It was so fun to run under the hook and not get hit by the killer, and then you had 0.5 seconds to break the hook and use dh. Then I made a guide on your forum, and a month or two later you nerfed the animations, and then dh, so it became impossible! And that's just one example!

It's definitely hard to get into when you are new but you'll get the hang of it just like with most games. I say this but at 500 hours i still royally suck and sort of run around like a headless chicken.  But still the mechanics are very simple though and for every time you play you learn more, get more map awareness and it just becomes muscle memory at some point and you sort of learn to do some stuff automatic.

Dead by Daylight,Some of the best and worst moments of my gaming life. Would not recommend unless you want to go through all the stages of grief.,False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"I've played this game on and off since it's release, through various iterations and updates.

I am mostly a survivor main.  I occasionally play killer.

I would not recommend this game to new players for numerous reasons, chief amongst them would be the sheer amount of work it would take to 'catch up' and the knowledge that comes along with every single perk (killer and survivor) in the game.  I would say that people don't even really begin to understand DbD until they reach about 300 hours in the game (Not I said understand; not master).  

On the survivor side; you have to deal with killers of various play styles. You've got some that are honorable and will not chase people off hooks, tunnel, slug, ect al.  You've got people who will chase the first thing that moves in front of them (I call these T-rex killers, affectionately of course).  And you've got the new meta of killers who will slug all 4 survivors and leave you to lay on the ground for 4-5 minutes until you bleed out and die.    Aside from being new and learning how to play the game, you will have to deal with the aforementioned killers (The last one is probably the worst and most common killer you will find these days) while practicing; which can be extremely aggravating and probably make you quit the game before you invest any serious amount of time into the game.

Survivors and killers(Except for the licensed ones) can be obtained through LONG gameplay.  (A typical killer will run you anywhere from 4,500 - 9,000 iridescent shards). I don't know the numerics for new accounts; but once your account reaches level 50, you will gain 300 shards per level increase.  You'll need about 4,200 exp to level up your account each time beyond 50.  You'll get around 600 exp per game; so ideally you'll gain a level every 7 matches.  9000 shards / 300 per level = 30 levels for each new character you want to unlock.    In a perfect world you're looking at 42 hours of gameplay for each unlock.... or you could just spend $5-10 to unlock a chapter granting you the killer and survivor. 

That's the first part.  You want their perks?  Well now you need to level up either one and prestige them 3 times to grant their three perks to the rest of your survivor/killers as maximum level perks.  (Each perk has 3 levels, each granting more stats than the last). 

Now we move on to cosmetics.  You see a really cute outfit on a character you like playing?  That'll run you anywhere from 500-24,000 iridescent shards depending on it's rarity.  Of course, this can be negated by paying real money. 

They do have seasonal battle passes (both normal and paid) that give cosmetic rewards and if you end up playing enough, I would say the $10 premium rewards are well worth it.",False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"the game used to be really fun but playing as a survivor has turned into a pretty painful experience. all the perks that gave survivors a chance have been nerfed. too many killers immediately start tunneling, camping and slugging at the beginning of the game while also having many perks for auras and regressing gens that help them with that. I get doing those things during the endgame but not with 3-5 gens left. they should put some soft of system in there that prevents them from doing that. it's also horrible how most teammates never even touch a gen or unhook anyone in time. all of the issues have become worse and worse in the past few months. not to mention my ping being good, the killers ping being bad and it messing with the chase lol",False,Strategy

Dead by Daylight,"I would love to recommend this game if it wasn't for it's current state. I started playing back in 2021 before taking a three year break for issues they never fixed. 

The game is terrible for new players, with the release of FNAF coming this summer (2025) it will surely bring in new players. But with the games health, all these players will not touch it again. 90% of perks are locked behind paywalls on both killer and survivor after already paying £15 for this game at base rate, most killers have special powers and abilities which is hard for new players to pick up in order to learn how to counter, each side (survivor or killer) is hard to grasp with many people outplaying you simply due to a larger experience as there isn't ~really~ an mmr system. I go against a range from very good killers/survivors to ones with minimal experience. Solo queue as a survivor is outrageously bad, I can't even fathom words for it. I wish there was a comp and casual game mode.

The game is terribly buggy with some bugs having remained in the game for YEARS (nurse bug im looking at you) or bugs in general take a long time to fix (if at all).

Dead by Daylight,"Don't be fooled into thinking this game is super awesome from all those nifty Youtube and Instagram shorts. It's been a rough road for many years.

This game HAD potential, and could have been a very great game, except that it was ruined by two things: 1) the most incompetent, unintelligent developers I've ever seen across the entire video game industry; and 2) the most toxic player community I've ever experienced.

I don't know if the developers have a faulty god complex or a severe, chronic case of OCD, etal. but they operate the game and control the community like a dictatorship. Granted, they're based in Canada, so they may be accustomed to that sort of stuff, but that doesn't resonate with people around the rest of the globe. These extremists have a grandiose vision of how you are supposed to act when you play their game and will micromanage every trend, every action, and punish the community over every little discrepancy that they deem ""wrong"". And apparently they get a kick out of punishing people, and are proud of themselves for it, because there's no indication that they're letting up. You can't say anything in the chatboxes, either. Why do the words ""die"", ""kill"", and ""hook"" get censored in a game about hooking and killing? Oh, and they pander to the gays and no one else. Go figure.

Furthermore, I have become more and more convinced over time that they have absolutely no knowledge of computer science. Each patch fixes ten bugs and causes twenty new ones. Most of the time, fixing one thing breaks another thing that is comparatively, completely unrelated. Why? How? Is your coding seriously that bad? It's the 21st Century. Video game companies should not still be fumbling around like they just discovered electricity. Come on, people (dictators*).

The overall neglect of recurring problems is the final of these three strikes against them. The community keeps telling them what needs fixing and they keep ignoring it. Do they even play their own game, or just throw out some half-@$$ patches every few months, hoping it calms the waters? Cheaters abound (despite the advertised anti-cheat system - news flash, guys {dictators*} - it apparently doesn't work, so you might want to do something about that), periodic issues with collision ruin games, and even their newest baby the 2v8 system has never-before-seen glitches. And what do the developers do? ""We are excited to announce a new string of cosmetics for your favorite characters to wear!"" Is this a 1v4 survival game or Barbie Dress-up? Cosmetics aren't good ""added content"" or ""rewards"" for crossing milestones (or paying sweet, sweet cash). We're bombarded with new outfits every month. If the developers would put as much effort into fixing their busted game as they do making new clothes that 0.5% of the community will ever use, they might actually craft a great game. If you guys want to design clothes and play dress-up, drop the video game career and open a fashion business. The best thing that could happen to this game is if its rights were sold to a different company. Hell, I'd prefer seeing Bethesda and Ubisoft collaborate than have the current team running the show.


And yet Behaviour is only half of the total problem. The other half is the pathetically awful player base they've attracted (created?). Now, I've never played Call of Duty, but I might even bet money that Dead by Daylight's community is worse than the stereotypical COD lobbies. Just look at the argumentative culture online amongst the players if you don't believe me. There is a huge rift among the players over every tiny issue, no matter what. It goes well beyond 'survivor mains v.s. killer mains'. That's only the tip of the iceberg. I could change 25% of one perk in the game and the community would explode. I could reconfigure the least-popular map and the community would explode.

People try to say that survivors are the most toxic players, but in my experience that's not true. It's only plausible/applicable to say that when you're facing a group of communicative friends playing together. Yet most of the time, you face four individuals when playing killer.
Playing against killers, on the other hand, drives you insane. Every killer plays the exact same way nowadays. They play almost as if they're robots, with no thought in their minds except ""I've got to get this 4-kill"". Very, very few killers have a personality at all anymore. They only care about getting you on the hook and moving on to the next person to do the same. Many of them can't even pick you up off the ground fast enough. It's like they've got money on the line. It's like a switch flips in their brains when they load in as killer, and they become almost, ALMOST inhuman. It's insane and I don't know how to fix it.

Somehow this game has attracted the scummiest gamers on the planet, but don't worry - the developers are about to release new cosmetics for your favorite character!

1. Horrible Balance Issues
The game is notorious for either favoring killers or survivors, depending on the latest patch. Survivors have overwhelming second-chance perks, making it nearly impossible to secure kills, while killers can sometimes be overpowered, leaving survivors with no real chance of escape. Instead of true balance, the game just swings wildly between patches, frustrating both sides.

2. Terrible Matchmaking & Ranking System
The matchmaking is a complete joke. New players often get matched against experienced killers or teams of survivors running meta perks, making the game incredibly unfun. On top of that, the ranking system doesn't reward actual skill—it's all about grinding.

3. Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs
For a game that's been out since 2016, Dead by Daylight still feels like an early-access title. Hitboxes are wildly inconsistent, killers swing through objects, and survivors teleport due to lag. Dedicated servers are unreliable, and random disconnections happen way too often.

4. The Grind is Exhausting
Unlocking perks, characters, and cosmetics is painfully slow unless you’re willing to shell out money. The progression system is designed to make players frustrated enough to spend on DLC and in-game currency. It’s more of a cash grab than a rewarding experience.

5. Toxic Community & Unfair Mechanics
The community is one of the worst in online gaming. Both survivors and killers constantly BM (bad-manner), teabag, or spam emotes. It feels like a never-ending loop of toxic behavior, whether you're winning or losing. If you’re a killer, expect to get flashlight spammed and mocked at the exit gate. If you're a survivor, expect face-camping and tunneling.

Final Verdict
Dead by Daylight is a frustrating, unbalanced mess that relies too much on its existing fanbase rather than fixing core gameplay issues. If you enjoy being annoyed by unfair matchmaking, game-breaking bugs, and a toxic community, then by all means, give it a try. Otherwise, save yourself the headache and play something else.

Dead by Daylight,"SBMM sucks the fun out of this (and most other) game(s). 

I started playing the game before SBMM, it was fun and had charm, was playable for hours. Now you get exhausted by 2 matches. It's not me, it's not you, it's SBMM and there's no pretending against it; these new killers (and new perks and the ones that are ""bad"") are all fairly cool and awesome, but their performance (not in-game, rather how much the playerbase enjoys them as new killers) is gutted by SBMM.

Remove SBMM and then there will be something worth my (and everybody else's) time and money.",False,Strategy

Dead by Daylight,"The game is VERY unbalanced. When DBD first came out, they released mid killers because they expected players to play in the ""hide and seek"" style. But over time, the maps became more diverse, the killers became better and more capable, and the survivors began to master the art of ""looping"" which is actively encouraged by the developers, ignoring the original idea of ​​""hide and seek"". This led to a terrible imbalance because it is IMPOSSIBLE to use the killers that came out with the release, since they are completely unsuited to the current gameplay. Therefore, without donating in this game, you will lose the money spent on the game, keyboard, mouse, monitor and the desire to live, because the developers, instead of listening to the community and buffing the killers who OBVIOUSLY need a buff (killers that were released with the release of the game), nerf the killers who were fine anyway and add anime skins to their store. This is not a game, it is a cash cow for the developers and an energy vampire for all players. I have met toxic players so often and you know, I understand them. Only toxic will be born in trash. This game was the PEAK once, now it is generally incomprehensible WHAT! A professional on Trapper has a lower chance of winning than an amateur on Dark Lord. I absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE to buy this game. However, if you are a masochist or an extreme person trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records for the most steely nerves of humanity - please welcome. Only a 6 year old child will consider this game ""horror"". This is a game in which shit tries to chase down 4 drops of urine that will teabag you because you play an imbecile killer who can't do a thing. I repeat, this game is NOT WHAT IT REPRESENTS. This is NOT a horror, this is Tom vs 4 Jerries in which, canonically, the ""pay 2 win"" mechanics work better on Jerry than on Tom.",False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"I have played this game for 1,600 hours. I do not recommend it. 

The game play has been getting worse and worse as I believe the developers have lost sight of what makes this game fun. Additionally, there is no way to separate the casual and competitive players which makes the game worse off for all casual players and competitive survivors. Furthermore, the community has been more and more toxic over the recent years. I come out of most game now, whether I win or lose the match, asking myself why I bothered to play it. If I were you, I would find another way to spend my time.",False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"Gonna be frank with yall. This game aint beginner friendly. 
The Tutorial only teaches you how to use your keyboard.

Dead by Daylight,"Been playing this game for years, and somehow, matchmaking is still a complete disaster. Either you get stomped by a full sweat squad or you wipe the floor with clueless newbies—no in-between. It’s like the devs don’t even try to balance it.

Then there’s the cosmetics. You spend money on a skin, only to find out you can’t even use it because of region locks. No warnings, no proper explanation—just ""oops, too bad."" And guess what? No refunds either. You pay for something you literally can’t use, and they just keep your money.

And while all this is happening, they keep adding fan-favorite horror characters to pull people in. They’ve got a community that loves horror, yet instead of actually focusing on fixing the game, they just pump out more skins and cash grabs. Balance? Bugs? Matchmaking? Nah, who cares—just buy more cosmetics.

Even in higher ranks, the teammates get no better. Its as if they are just throwing bots into lobbies.

Generators take way to long, healing is way to long, the perks are in many but all so useless and the ones that are good is whats wrong with the game, its gone from hiding from a killer and having that scary idea in the game to basically being seen 24/7 and having all generators blocked. there is just no fun factor in this anymore and its targeted for the top 1% player, no casual aspect what so ever.

Dead by Daylight,"Dead by Daylight is extremely fun almost addicting at times. albeit most people will claim that the game is survivor sided or killer sided are either inexperienced or have not researched into the perks and abilities to understand what ""balancing"" both killers and players actually entails. by no means is the game perfect with the evident shrinkage of maps and the removal of pallets in areas that was used frequently for survivors to escape from the killer. However, survivors and killers are supposed to have unique perks that are used to benefit each side, both come with pros and cons like every other multiplayer game. Players of the game need to understand that a game evolves overtime and no game is perfect regardless of how addicted we are to it.

Killers has unnecessarily stop/OP perks or Abilities that give them Some sort of speed increase or become undetectable On a short cool down, Even having the ability to down you from full HP to being on the floor in one hit. 
The game even gives them Walls with perks that allow them to see auras for far too long on Downing, hooking or killing some one and To add to all the Constant grief/trolling by your own teammates or the killer, Killers who refuse to hook you as the last one alive so the game wont end so you either wait or leave and get penalized with a wait time to que again.
Teammates who body block you, run the killer to you, refuse to help with gens, unhook people and so forth

They also have an event going on for a 2v8 that is not well liked to the point they have to add bots to every single game to fill it out as well as Up the BP you get from each match by 400%(as of right now) to Entice players to Que for it and still people are Queing as bots are in every lobby, Que times as a killer are 10 minutes plus+

a. They would rather ban players from all their social networks that criticize them instead of being transparent. 

3.  No accountability for their incompetence.

a.  Several instances of players providing them proof of hackers or their accounts being hacked and banned while the developers ignore them.  They refuse to investigate to reverse these unwarranted bans unless a big content creator makes a uproar about it, leaving those with no social media influence out of luck.

b. They treat the killer role as second class players (Civ 5 incident 2018 for one example).  If killer role finds a new strategy to use, they will quickly nerf it into the ground before nerfing anything for survivors.  They pander to survivors to appease them leaving their overpowered strategies to linger for much longer periods of time.  

C.  Pettiness of BHVR, removing twitch shirts of content creator for criticism, banning players for criticism, removing fog whisperer for speaking the truth.  Anything that goes against their ""squeaky clean appearance"" will get swept away to mitigate the player base from learning the truth of their incompetence.

But it's just WILD. You go around and fight storms, enemies, cold and learn to survive. The environment and music is quite charming. You get good rewards for exploring and traveling, sometime trying very dangerous things.

The union between gear, food and buildings is really great. Bosses that feels like invincible once you understand what type of gear, potions you need and how to use structures to your advantage become doable.

Honestly grindy game, makes up for it in asthetics, replayability, world sizes, varieties, and flexbility. There is no time limit. Just you, your friends if you please, ignorance from reality, and bliss.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"A solid survival game experience that's somewhat marred by grinding tedium and deaths that are too punishing at times.

For a game this small it's impressive how atmospheric and good looking it can be, showing that more polygons doesn't automatically mean a prettier game.  Whether it's a raging storm with rolling surf and rising water, an eerie quiet foggy day or just a beautiful sunset, it's pretty easy to get lost in the atmosphere of this game, especially when you're snuggled up indoors cooking roast deer over a hearth whilst rain pelts down outside.

The game progression tied to boss encounters gives you the carrot on a stick to keep moving forward which is certainly challenging at times, but gives you a reason to grind out gear levels to get stronger.

That said, grinding out said gear doesn't automatically equate to success and the inevitable corpse run back to claim your loot whilst also getting a skill drain punishment feels like a tedious gameplay mechanic that doesn't really encourage risk taking or exploration.  After having to do this a few times, you'll likely start looking up YouTube boss strategies to cheese the encounters as the bosses (whilst looking impressive) are all the usual bullet sponges that are 'weak to X weapon' which is often boring and cliche.

Whilst some people thrive on the machonistic challenge of these sorts of mechanics and chase that 'win against the odds' a-la-Dark Souls, the rest of us just want to build pretty castles and go fishing.  It's a tough world being a viking and Valheim will certainly put your skill and patience to the test, but the rewards are there if you can stick with it.

Make no mistake, this game is a brutal survival game experience.  It's punishing and often times frustrating, but has gameplay hook that makes it hard to just not give it one more go.  The world presentation is great, the atmosphere excellent and the general 'vibe' of the viking experience is captured well.

I have a few hundred hours logged on Valheim on Xbox (Series X) and now play on PC.  The game plays well on both systems, but of course if you have a good PC you can really take this game to the next level on presentation and performance.  Whether you're a controller or KBM player, this game has you covered and it even plays well on Steam Deck (which I have).  One of the benefits of such a small game install that punches above it's weight.

This is certainly a good game in the genre and hits many notes to make this one an easy recommendation (especially on sale), just be ready for the inevitable progression roadblocks and tedious grinding mechanics which can be make or break for you depending on your preferred playstyle.  Valheim is a test of endurance as much as it is skill with some encounters making you feel like you were unfairly treated, but you'll be hard pressed not to want to grit the teeth and give it one more go.

Valheim,"For me this is the most eminently playable of the 'Open World Survival Craft' games, particularly solo or with friends, owing to well-balanced mechanics that include every part of the game world into systems worth continuously interacting with, even during long or advanced play sessions. The retro aesthetic and freeform procgen fully modifiable game world draw comparisons to minecraft, but with decidedly more progressive, biome-based gameplay, creating a more hardcore and drawn out experience.

The creativity the game does give you, mostly to do with building, farming and shaping the terrain, is more than enough to flex your artistic side while still keeping your attention on gameplay and survival. The warmth, weather and comfort systems are just enough to encourage innovative and convenient structures that are fully functional.

The food and hunting/farming systems are likewise enough to make extra effort worth it, but never completely necessary. The game has a remarkable ability to avoid tedium while still necessitating constant effort and attention to its varied mechanics. The very real threat of death and progression loss makes the safety of early biomes and resources relevant even in the late game.

If you like building forts in a wilderness that never fully gives in, while raiding enemies and dungeons and leveling up and crafting your character to perfection, this is for you. There is always something to do and it never feels boring. Don't be intimidated, as this is often a relaxing game and I hope they add a few more complications and difficulties throughout!",True,Strategy

Valheim,"I really like the core concept of this game and its gameplay mechanics, it’s a verry fun game to play with my friends. The combat is very simple but tense, the resource gathering is engaging and the base building (though a bit finnicky) is relaxing. It, however, is filled with many little inconveniences that add up to making the game a frustrating time sink. And I feel like the crux of the issue must be with how the game deals with death.

When you die, you lose your equipment. You will have to run back to collect it, this is not so bad early game where you can take a hit and everything is close by. But later in the game many of the enemies will one shot you, or the environment will kill you (such as the cold in the mountains). You will have to make use of food or potions to recollect your stuff. But if you die whilst getting your stuff or shortly thereafter you will have to use another set of potions and food buffs, because those are also lost on death. This would not be so bad if farming was not so intentionally obnoxious, for pretty much every major food item in the game you need something that is not easily renewable, such as berries from bushes that are not replant able and only respawn after 300 minutes or mushrooms that only respawn at the same place in one type of biome after 240 minutes and are therefore also not replant able. 

and if you somehow die in a late game area whilst under geared, and there is no portal nearby because you felt like exploring a bit at first. Guess what, you can say goodbye to your hard-earned gear. That gear that took you many hours to get and upgrade and is therefore not easily replaceable. And to top it all off, every time you die, you lose a LOT of your skill levels. So you end up losing even more hours of time through that as well.

And you will be dying a LOT in this game, because every time you move in to a new biome your current gear becomes obsolete. You will die to leaches poison, you will die to wolfs stun locking you to death, you will die to death mosquitos. All whilst you are struggling to spend hours grinding for that next set of armor and weapons, only to find out that the boss you will have to go up against is resistant to your weapons damage type. Or almost all damage types available to you if you are up against bone mass who is only weak to blunt or a damage type not available to you yet. So you have to back and to the mines and make new gear again.

all this combined makes for a farming game where you can not farm the things you need, a resource game where the resources you have gathered lose relevance the moment you move to the next area, and an exploration game that does not want you to explore because you will lose everything if you do.  It feels like a game that does not just want you to spend time on the game, it wants you to waste it.

Valheim,"Great game in general, enjoyed most of the game however a few negative aspects build up and climax in the final biome :)

 However the content loop is very linear for the most part and can get dry:
Farm/loot - New gear/Food - boss - repeat
Bosses have been too easy, completing the biome in general and getting to the boss fight is much more challenging than the boss itself. (plains is a joke)

The Tether range is complete bullshit and needs to be revised, enemies will chase you until they die from natural causes.

Missing Basic Quality of life - Craft from chest, SEARCH FUNCTION for menus?!?!?

Final Biome is straight up not fun to play. Huge hoards of enemies that you are not prepared for when you first arrive, and once you die once... enjoy 500 enemies chasing you all the way to your tombstone, joining the hoard that already killed you and then making the army of things defending you body even bigger!!!!!!!!

Valheim,"I just realized I've never left a review on this game.

My first ever PC game was Minecraft, and when I was younger I loved that game. Now a days, I can't get behind it. Something about playing the game as it was intended just doesn't tickle my fancy anymore, and I've never liked the mini-game servers in the first place.

Valhiem brings me back that joy of playing Minecraft. I've yet to finish the game, and am still discovering things, but I have completed at least over half of its progression. And yet, I still find myself coming back and enjoying it. I'm probably why our worlds take so long because I spend my time building while my friends wanna rush the next boss. I enjoy the difficulty of the game where it's super easy to get into, but it has a learning curve and if you wanna survive, you need to start getting better and start understanding how everything works.

The only thing I will say is that the game isn't very fun when alone. I feel like a big factor of this game is its building mechanics (which also have a learning curve) and when you can't show off your builds, it's alittle more lame. That and it's fun to goof off with your buddies. I'm sure some people will enjoy the game by themselves, but for me it's once again like Minecraft, I just can't enjoy it by myself.",True,Strategy

Lots of ups and downs, can be very grindy and repetitive, but I believe it has the foundation to be one of the best survival games.

At the beginning we had 4 full time players with a couple that would join, and we ended with me and only a friend finishing it. So Iron Gate, please make Valheim great again. p.s. give the trader an item that lets you recall your spear when you throw it plz :)",True,Strategy
Valheim,"Now, don't get me wrong: I'm not here to throw shit at a good game, but I've reached the ashlands so let's start:

What the game does well:
- Offers a pretty good and immersive survival theme;
- A really nice exploration, with pretty stunning visuals (if your machine can render it) inspired by norse mithology;
- A good taming and breeding mechanic (although some little changes could be applied here and there);
- Nice boats;
- A nice construction mechanic (although so much stuff can't be accessed, even a lot of nice pieces already existing in game);
- Some nice pieces of equipment;

What is missing/could be improved:

- The combat system:
  Right now, the character is locked on the Y axis, meaning that you can't hit enemies unless they're directly in front of you, 
  as soon as they're positioned slightly up or down on Y axis compared to 
  you, they become impossible to hit... which would not be a problem if: 
  - the terrain wasn't mostly uneven, meaning it's hard to find a good plain field (especially in later biomes) that allows you 
    to fight back;
  - The enemies aren't Y plane locked... meaning they can hit you while you can't hit them back;
  - The enemies attacks have weird hit boxes, making them hit you even if you manage to put some extra distance from 
     them.
- Blocking doesn't consume stamina based on how much damage you block, it's fixed per attack... which means that an hit 
   that would literally deal no damage still requires the same amount of stamina to block it would've required with worse 
   gear on... making weaker attacks actually better face tanked than blocked and a lot of attacks just not worth it;
- The stagger mechanic: you can get staggered even with full stamina while blocking... which makes fighting strong 
   enemies a lot harder than it needs to be since they're gonna perma stagger you no matter what. Also some enemies have 
   such a short stagger timer in the first place, it's just so hard to capitalize on it even under the best of circumstances;
- Knockback: knockback is so unreliable when used against enemies and it's pretty wonky on the player too: sometimes 
   you'll be sent flying from blocking the weakest attack, sometimes you won't move from the same attack, sometimes 
   parrying an enemy attack will push the enemy so far back you can't capitalize on it, some other times the enemy will be 
   stuck in place and allow you a full combo and even to stunlock them.
 - Multi target damage penalty: while I find this an interesting game mechanic, it's badly implemented and makes every 
   weapon but the sword mostly useless... It could actually be used to differentiate weapons, making some better on 1 vs 1 
   and others better at group control, but it's not the case right now.
 - Enemy aggro: enemies aggro is too heavy... you'll get aggroed from so far away sometimes that you can't even see them 
   coming, especially later on in the game. Also: losing most enemies is hard af even with higher levels in running;
 - Skill levels feel underwhelming and most of the times are just not satisfying even when you do notice the difference;
- Stamina system:
 - Too many actions require an honestly stupidly high amount of stamina (farming, building, mining... it's frustrating);
 - Weapons of higher tier require more stamina to use than weapons of lower tier from the same category, meaning that 
   losing stamina is actually more punishing the higher you weapon tier;
- Bad and missing gear: too many times I've found weapons missing from a tier: Axes, Maces, Bows... which forces you to 
   just not upgrade or to change weapon:
  - Maces are just SO BAD... Unless you use 2 handed hammers, anything after the iron mace is... useless or too situational. 
    Also not every tier has a 1 handed mace;
  - Axes are not weapons: Just use a sword, axes suck, the 2 handed ones are kinda good but still swords are just too much 
    better. Also not every tier has a 1 handed axe to use;
  - Spears are meh: theyr normal attack is... bad and theyr throw is even worse, but at least they're fun to use;
  - Fists are useless unless you use one weapon you get mid game that falls off incredibly fast;
  - 2-handed weapons are far too scarce... there's just not enough of them;
  - Bows are good, but we need more of them: not all tier of equip have them which means sometimes you change 3 times 
     in a single tier, other it takes 3 tiers to change once. Also: no zoom mechanic when firing them; 
- So many pieces are missing from the building mechanic, most of them already exist in game too you just can't get them 
  at all, also: existing pieces can only be rotated on one axis, making the absence of some pieces even more noticeable and 
  limitating;
- Not all crops can be farmed: I know the devs have already expressed themselves on this, but I honestly would love the 
  option to choose both for gameplay purposes and for aestethic purposes: why not make it work like the portals option?
- Hard to control ground level... it's so hard to adjust the ground level or to make a steep but kind of low alture to get a hard 
  to reach high ground;
- Boats get stuck too easily and are too hard to free.

I do like the game and I understand that it's still in early acces... but it's so frustrating to play (especially solo) when so many things go so much against the player...
Do I recommend the game? Sure, definitely, but we need at least the most frustrating aspects fixed.

Optional point I would like but are kinda just personal preferences:
- Make more mobs tameable: Hares and Necks would be cool to tame too (necks could use fish while hares carrots/Jotunn 
   Puffs);
- Add more mobs to older biomes:
 - The meadows lack a big, strong enemy: Maybe add bears?;
 - Rancid Bones are too rare and in general: give all human-type monster access to more weapons;
- Some foods are too easy to amass (like wolf meat... you don't even need to tame them or even cloud berries) while 
   others are too hard to even get (ooze is a good example, but there are quite a few)... maybe make some mobs a bit less 
   rare;
- Serpents are too hard to find: why not make it so they are more likely to appear the more bosses you have slain? Also 
   bring the spwn check counter down... 1000 seconds for each chunk is far too much... make it something like 300/360 
   seconds (5-6 minutes) and maybe make them even more likely to appear with more ppl close;
- Just add more accessories: items like pouches, backpacks and stuff that add more space to the inventory, maybe more 
  accessories that just give different efect (more stam recovery, more health regen, resistance to some damages, more 
  damage with melee weapons, stronger knockback, more stagger resistance, all sorts of effects);
- Add one piece of gear (gloves) and more weapon/armor tiers with different effects (to give more gameplay customization 
  options);
- Give more uses to some materials that are literally used for one thing only and then become totally useless;
- Make ""special"" weapons untiered: poison, fire, thunder, frost, spirit damage should be imho, not within 
  a specific tier of weapons but should rather be upgrades you put on your weapons of choice;
- Add Boss gear: Add some more weapons like the stagbreaker, maybe even give them theyr own special upgrading system 
  that allow them to be relevant later on too.",True,Strategy

Valheim,"Played this as a group of five. We wanted to enjoy this, and at times, we really did. But many of those times it was because we all had something to collectively gripe about.

On paper, Valheim looks great, big open world with many biomes, bosses to overcome, bases to build, armour and weapons to forge and other mechanics on the side for when you need a little downtime.
In reality, a lot of the time it feels like a bunch of loosely related, half thought out mechanics all thrown together to deliver an underwhelming, sometimes frustrating experience. Games need to do one of two things to be good: be original or be well executed. Unfortunately, Valheim achieves neither.

The most robust system in the game is probably the building system; a good number of parts, snapping options, even structural stability needs to be accounted for! While I did tinker with it myself a couple of times, a couple of my teammates spent much more time with it. I think all of us can agree that there's just enough caveats, little problems and inconsistencies in the way it works that what should be a fun or chill time spent building out a new structure in your camp can quickly become frustrating as you try to get pieces to align that just plain refuse to. And that's before you get the land deformation tools involved.

Taking the other extreme as another example, boss fights are quite the spectacle. Theme music for each one, lots of visual effects reserved just for use in that one fight, pretty fleshed out attack sets and the skybox will even change for some of them. They'll happily chew through terrain in their attempts to take you down. 
Bosses are often placed in far flung locations, so players will often need to either travel by portal to get there or set up a little mini-base to reset their spawn to be nearby. And that's the rub; die during a boss fight and you're doomed to spend the remainder of it either sat twiddling your thumbs at home while everyone else cracks on, hoping one of your teammates has the resources, and time, to throw a portal together after your initial location got destroyed or, especially in later bosses, you get stuck in the loop of graverunning, getting mowed down in one of the boss's many many area attacks, rinse, repeat.

This is a pattern throughout pretty much all the various systems in the game. A good idea on paper, but not given quite enough thought to be enjoyable. It feels like they either rushed from design straight into development, or didn't spend the time to circle back and playtest thoroughly.

However, this doesn't mean that Valheim isn't savable. The devs just need to pump the breaks on the content releases and spend time iterating on their mechanics, fleshing them out a little more and adding polish to what they have. I hope they do.

I genuinely hate to dislike games from small and independent studios; they're where the true heart and soul of creative game development lives. However, unfortunately, I really can't recommend Valheim. The enjoyable moments are enough to keep you coming back, but at no point was I looking forward to playing it. While we did complete it, or at least as far as we could with current content, there was a definite sense of relief rather than triumph. After an almost in-game (and real life) year, it was finally over, the challenge was overcome, and we'd be able to move on to something else.",False,Strategy
Valheim,"Valheim – A Masterpiece of Atmosphere and Adventure
Valheim is more than just a survival game, it’s an experience, a world that pulls you in and refuses to let go. In an era where many games focus on realism and hand-holding, Valheim stands out as a breath of fresh air, embracing a PlayStation 2-esque art style that feels both nostalgic and stunning in its own way. The low-poly visuals, reminiscent of RuneScape and The Legend of Zelda, blend seamlessly with its breathtaking lighting and atmospheric effects, creating a world that feels alive.

From the moment you step into Valheim, the world is yours to explore. Odin may have sent you here, but your fate is in your own hands. Whether you choose to carve out a peaceful existence as a builder, fisherman, and farmer or venture into the wilds to challenge the game’s mythical beasts, Valheim offers a deep and rewarding sandbox. Progression follows a gear-based system similar to Terraria, where gathering resources and crafting better equipment is the key to surviving its many dangers.

One of Valheim’s greatest strengths is its dynamic world. One moment, you're lost in the serenity of chopping wood, fishing by the shore, or listening to the ambient sounds of the wind and water. The next, the ground trembles beneath you as trolls emerge from the forest, threatening everything you’ve built. These unexpected moments make every playthrough feel unique and immersive. The game doesn’t hold your hand—it encourages creativity, perseverance, and a true Viking spirit.

Valheim is best with friends, and captures a sense of adventure and camaraderie that other survival games lack. Whether solo or with friends, the game thrives on emergent storytelling—epic battles, daring raids, and tales of survival that rival those of legendary sagas.

For those seeking a survival game that values atmosphere, challenge, and freedom, Valheim is a must-play. It’s not just a game, it’s a journey, and one that you’ll want to relive time and time again.

Valheim,"From the concept, to the graphics, game-play, and sound design, this game is a piece of art. It captures the Survival / Crafting / Base building / Exploration aspect of the genre while seamlessly blending it into beautiful proceeduraly generated worlds and guides you at your own pace to explore and learn of the vengeful inhabitants of the 10th realm. 

The game can be played equally well solo at your own pace, or with friends for maximum shinnanigans and the multiplayer system is both simiple and streamlined allowing for the transfer of characters, resources, and even map data to keep everyone caught up and swinging their axes as hordes of dark beasts try to crush you and your companions. 

There are a number of resource grinds in the game that can slow down the pace of progression for those who like to unlock everything and get maximum upgrades, but players much more skilled than I have proven that you arent required to completely build up before reaching each new game stage, but if you're struggling, then spending some time farming for new foods, or digging up more ore to upgrade weapons and armor, or building up your strongholds to gain access to new tools offers a respite from the carnage allowing you to engage with the game however you wish and dictate your playstyle. 

There's a lot that could be said about specific mechanics or updates or biomes or bosses, but I encourage players to discover these for themselves as the fun of playing a game is, well, playing the game! All in all, it's a wonderful game and I can not recommend it highly enough.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"Truly one of the greatest recent games in the last 5, maybe even 10 years. The developers have put enormous effort into this game, and they are doing good on their word to bring this game to 1.0 so that it's complete. I only played maybe 12 hours at release and really enjoyed it, but now early 2025 this game has so much that's been breathed into it. The building ALONE is one of my favorite things about this game. It can take some getting used to at first, but finishing your first house truly is an amazing feeling.

Where this game really shines in my opinion is the exploration and the progression. Venturing into new zones are dangerous and you need to ease into it and be as prepared as possible, because you are going to die, and it is going to be a steep learning curve once you get to the swamp. (which I'm still navigating) When you get an upgrade, you SERIOUSLY feel it. The jump you make even from a simple flint dagger to a bronze sword really makes you feel like you earned it, and upgrading your gear feels so good. 

Be prepared for a long haul on this game. If you rush it, you're doing it wrong. Build up a base, explore, gather, and over prepare yourself, because you're going to need it for the difficult foes.

All in all, if you're on the fence about starting this, I can say this is one of the best games I've ever played, and the changelog alone is pretty impressive to see how frequently the devs are updating to make the game as stable as possible.

Valheim,"I decided to give Valheim a try after reading several recommendations on Reddit—boy, was that a mistake. The game has been in early access since early 2021, and nearly four years later, it still feels severely lacking in content.

At first, Valheim has a certain charm, but that quickly wears off once you realize how bare-bones it is. The world feels empty, with only 3-5 enemy types per biome. After venturing beyond the Black Forest, the second biome, it becomes painfully obvious how repetitive and lifeless the world is. While the procedurally generated map might seem vast, it fails to provide meaningful content. Each biome forces you to fight the same handful of enemies repeatedly, making exploration feel like a chore rather than an adventure.

On top of that, the game is a massive time sink. Gathering ore takes hours, hunting deer takes hours—you get the idea. Normally, I wouldn't mind a grind-heavy game, but the issue here is that the effort rarely feels rewarding. The biomes are half-baked, the combat is clunky, and all the weapons feel like they share the same dull animations. Even the boss fights are lackluster; Moder, the ice dragon, can barely move properly in its own environment.

And one more thing—I dislike when players claim this game is complex and requires planning. No, it doesn’t. It takes neither skill nor strategy. Sailing for two hours across an empty, unfinished ocean just to find a boss locator—because the first ten identical islands didn’t have one—isn’t ""depth""; it’s just bad game design.

Even writing this review drained my stamina bar, and now I'm stuck in my chair, dreading the fact that I played this game longer than I should have—believing other players when they said, ""it gets better."" It doesn’t.

Overall, I’d give Valheim a 6/10. Calling it ""early access"" at this point feels like pure copium from its hardcore fans.

Valheim,"A game with good bones that unfortunately didn't build upon them in a meaningful way. 

Every single biome is just get the new crop to make better food, spend an absurd amount of time mining the new ore to make the same weapons and armor with higher numbers, then fight the boss. The Mistlands at least finally provided some variation on this by introducing magic and weapon enchantments, but pretty much every other biome is identical in progression and has nothing new to offer  beyond ""enemy that does more damage"".

This would make the game fairly mediocre already, but what finally pushes it over the edge into a negative review is the glacially slow development of the game. Since launch into EA in 2021 the only major updates to the game have been 2 additional biomes and one update that added more to build at your base. The other 2 ""named"" updates just added 2 new traders that barely change anything about the game.

So essentially over 4 years of development we got 2 new biomes to do the exact same loop as the previous ones, and a magic system that you cant even access til you're near the end of the game.

Valheim,"If you're like me and having an unfinished campaign in a game leaves you increasingly uneasy the longer it drags out, then this is not a game for you.

You'd probably have to pour in a full man-month of WORK to finish the bosses. And it feels like work. Which is absolutely absurd and I am ashamed that I kept going so long just to ""get over with it"".
The devs provide some facilities in order to make the game a bit less time intensive. I did use them, yet, they weren't nearly enough. I had to resort to cheats to keep myself going to the last boss of the originally released game. I have absolutelty no desire to see what the new biomes and bosses are about. Anyway, I think I have a pretty good Idea about the gameplay loop at this point: 
- You get into a new biome and get your arse handed to you by the new mobs. 
- You start the tedious process of mining and gathering the new resources. This usually drags out a few hours since most gear is abysmally expensive. At this point you'll get the feeling that this is just to squeeze the last bit of playtime out of the few bits of new content that are actually there.
(- if you're insane enough to not activate teleporting metals in standard portals you'll be ferrying your ressources across the ocean a few times. Add another half hour per trip.)
- Once you're strong enough to navigate the new biome somewhat routinely, it's time to think about the next boss. However, you have to find him first. For some bosses, I literally had to scan six or seven biomes. I searched four or five hours for Yagluth and online discussions imply that I was lucky to find him that quickly. And apparently this gets worse for the later bosses. 
- Every single boss after the first one takes just fucking forever to kill. There is a fine line between a tough boss and one where even the intended way of fighting him feels cheesy because you're doing the same movement over and over and over again - Valheim manages to overshoot that line by a german mile.

Valheim,"I've enjoyed this game for years now.  Mother of 2 teens/preteens- this is the ideal family game...  My husband and both of my kids enjoy it.  We love playing together and working on building projects or boss fights.  My brother and a few of our friends who live across the world also join us periodically in spurts. It is a good space for bonding with those you love as well showcasing each individual's personal creativity.  We adults very much enjoy the difficulty of survival.. We have our server set to ""player based progression"" so that someone who hasn't reached certain difficulty mile-markers doesn't experience the raids at their base as heavily as those of us who love harder content.  That update has made this game worlds better for muti-player since some love difficult content and some enjoy just building/farming.  You can play this game cooking/farming/building ""stardew valley"" style or you can be a murder hobo who likes a giant challenge.  The building options are fun and superb.

The building is excellent and gives you a nice break from the battling. The boss fights are exciting and exponentially more difficult. Its a game that rewards you for your preparation and punishes you for your lack of it. It respects your skills to the point that you can survive on them but also allows you to mitigate the need for perfect parries and perfect stamina management with ol' fashion preparation although there will be times you inevitably get yourself in some very stick situations.

I especially enjoy the ability to play with others without complications.

This is definitely in my top 3 of open world survival/crafting games.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"I like Valheim a lot, but I think it needs some balancing before it is ready for its full 1.0 release. Either that, or it needs more server settings to compensate for certain gameplay decisions that some of its playerbase may not appreciate as much at others. This may be your cup of tea, but you may also fall into my camp and you'll need an update before you can give the game your full, wholehearted endorsement. My endorsement as it is, I feel about 70% satisfied.

Essentially, when I only have about 2-3 hours on the weekends to play this game with my friend, we are under constant awareness of the real-life time pressures that we're under in order to experience all the content this game has to offer. We like completing the co-op games that we buy, but Valehim suffers severely from diminishing returns and punishing balance issues that make it a frustrating slog to play through with its intended mechanics.

We disabled the portals issue where you can't teleport with ore, because we thought this was absolutely exhausting. And we played the game legitimately up until around the late mountains/early plains biome before we found ourselves regularly cheating, because it ended up not being worth the real-life time investment to travel back to our bodies, get our stuff back, risk getting sniped by a mosquito in the process, and do it over and over again. Or, it ended up not being worth the real-life time investment to go and farm ingredients from previous, unchallenging zones, so we'd cheat in the ingredients in order to continue progression at a worthwhile pace. 

This is due to a mismatch in personal values from the intended game experience vs. the real life time commitment required to progress. While some players may enjoy the punishing grind that this game demands of its audience, I found that the frustration factor slowly ate away the fun factor until I was worn down and the temptation of regularly cheating got too much to bear.

I still am having fun with it. We are exploring the Mistlands now, though based on what I know of the Ashlands biome, this might be the biome that fully does in my patience to complete the game. The game's later zones seems to have mistaken ""frustrating grind"" for ""challenge."" My friend and I love a challenge; we enjoyed V Rising immensely and were not compelled to cheat to progress. Valheim, however, offers ""challenge"" in the form of ""oh no! You ran out of a low-tier ingredient, and have to spend hours farming up more food!"" or ""Oh no! You got randomly sniped by a mob because you got stuck on a piece of world geometry and the mob was 2 pixels higher than your sword was, so even though your sword visibly connected with the mob, you actually hit the ground and you ran out of stamina and then died. Guess you have to run all the way back to your body and try not to die again in the process! Oh, and you also have to eat a bunch of your good food so you can survive the journey! :)"" 

Some mobs also become bullet sponges in the late game, and the game doesn't give you the gear upgrades necessary to combat them in a timely manner. The mobs that flood the Infested Mines take a very long time to kill with the tier of gear that we have access to- and I know that these mines have cores which will give us access to the next tier of gear- but we went through like 6 of these mines and there were only 1-2 cores in each when we need like, 15. This requires sailing to other Mistlands islands, finding more of these dungeons, only to disappointedly get 2 cores out, rinse and repeat.

Compare to the challenge of the early game dungeons, where you only needed to raid about 2-3 of them to find enough Sultring Cores needed to build your first forge. The early dungeons were still challenging for the level of gear and food we had access to, but it wasn't such a huge time sink as to demand us to invest 10 hours of gameplay time just to get the ingredients to progress.

Therefore, I think this issue would be fixed by adding a few settings for more casual players like me, such as: option to not drop ANYTHING on death, and increase the spawn rate of items. More cores in the late dungeons, more drops from mobs, more drops from farmed ingredients, less time required to process said ingredients. It would also help to reduce the health pool of the more tankier mobs that take a long time to kill. I also think the game's physics should be tweaked slightly to make getting stuck on world geometry less egregious; I can't tell you how many times I stabbed a monster only for my dagger to strike a tiny particle of land that was in my way, eat away my stamina, and leave me open for an unfair counterattack. (And I HATE it when I 'fail' in a video game due to no fault of my own, but a fault of mechanics that seem unintended.)

All that said, when Valheim works, it works really well. There's a fun gameplay loop between base building and combat progression. I love the chill aspects of building up a Viking settlement and making it function efficiently. I like the feeling of power progression as you gain access to stronger and stronger gear, which makes traversal of older zones trivial. It makes you feel that you are truly contending with the corrupt gods of the land, and becoming a powerhouse in turn. I enjoy discovering new areas, learning the tricks to traversing them, and conquering the mobs that live there. There is nothing wrong with the difficulty of the experience- only the times where it feels artificially contrived just to make you invest more and more time in each new zone. While some people do think this is challenging and want a pure hardcore experience, I really don't have the time in my life for that.

TLDR: ""Difficulty"" should not equate to ""takes a longer time to do things."" I've got things to do and places to be. The game should fundamentally respect my time.",True,Strategy

Valheim,"Valheim – An Unforgettable Viking Adventure

Valheim is more than just a survival game—it's an epic journey filled with adventure, camaraderie, and unforgettable memories. I first stepped into this vast and beautifully crafted world alongside five friends, and together, we faced countless challenges, built mighty settlements, and explored every corner of its mythical lands. One of our greatest achievements was defeating Fader, the formidable boss of the Ashlands, a battle that pushed our skills and teamwork to the limit.

But Valheim's magic doesn’t fade. I’m preparing to return once more, ready to take on Fader again and gear up for the highly anticipated Deep North update. The game’s constant evolution, immersive exploration, and rewarding progression make every playthrough feel fresh and exciting. Whether you're sailing treacherous seas, battling fearsome creatures, or simply enjoying the beauty of this Viking-inspired world, Valheim offers an adventure unlike any other.

Valheim,"9.5/10. Highly recommend. Valheim is the survivalcraft game that kickstarted a million others trying to ride its success and recapture its magic. They all fail. Here's why:

1. Crafting is with Lego's, not Pre-Fabs
You want to make a toilet, a bar, a pool table? Do it with the 1x1 wall pieces, item stands, and name signs Valheim gives you and feel great about it. There's no bathtub piece that you can only place a certain way. You can build whatever you want and in whatever orientation you want to, all within a fun physics system that allows you to build in trees and off the sides of cliffs in weird but satisfying ways.

2. No Resource Bloat
In so many survivalcraft games you lose track of the infinitude of ingredients, crafting stations, and so on, all just to make a bunch of armors and items you'll never use. Valheim doesn't (or at least not until Mistlands...). Think you won't need a poison resist potion? Think again. Every enemy drops something you can use, and everything you can make from the small shelf of ingredients you do find has a use.

2. No Polygons, No Problem
Visually, Valheim knows what makes a game look good: internal art consistency, and lighting. That's it. This game looks like it could've come out in 2000 (and will run on a computer of that age too), but looks better than most triple A games. More polygons are not always better. Understanding how to use those polygons is what matters.

3. Grinding can be Fun? 
Unlike every other game that has you collect wood and stone by pressing a key enough times in the most boring fashion possible, Valheim lets you chain together trees by felling them into each other. It's hard to describe how satisfying that is. Or, you can mine out the entire area of earth around an ore vein so the vein explodes all at once. Try it with silver in the mountains. So satisfying. If fishing had the Stardew Valley minigame, it would be perfect!

4. Difficult, but not Impossible. Challenging, but Fair. Brutal, but Beatable.
Valheim (until the custom settings update) had aura. It was legendary. When you heard Valheim, you thought despair-inducing, seemingly unscaleable mountain that many will be unable or unwilling to defeat. 
...But not because it was cheap or unfair or ridiculous, but rather because you, the player, couldn't measure up. 
If you scale this mountain called Valheim, the catharsis of knowing what you've achieved is worth it. The time you spent in this game will have felt infinitely more meaningful than the time you spent in so many others.

5. Shared Trauma
Play with a small group of friends, not alone. This game was designed for a party. You will bond with that group over your shared failures. And then overcoming those failures. Playing with others becomes playing FOR others. You will become soldiers in a foxhole, all fighting for each other, for survival, and for victory.  

A few missteps:
The Mistlands. What happened to cause this 6th zone to diverge so much from the first 5? This feels like a different game, and not in a good way. Resource bloat, a boss with way, way too many summons, limited number of P.O.I.'s and difficult-to-access resources for a zone so horrendous to navigate. First, this biome reduces your vision range so you can't plan out where you're going or how to backtrack. And the wisp that clears the mist (so you can see) follows you on a delay, forcing you to constantly wait for it to catch up with you and reveal the terrain in front of you. This in itself isn't terrible, but it becomes terrible because the Mistlands terrain is nothing but jagged and steep mountains that spill into dangerous rivers and lakes. It is too unnavigable, even after acquiring the feather cape. Improve this by either having the wisp clear the mist permanently in places you've been, or at least have the mountains topographically marked on the map so you can actually chart a course through the zones. As it stands, the Mistlands (despite how cool magic is to use) remains a black mark on an otherwise nearly perfect game.
Also note that foggy weather while sailing is in the same vein. Having vision reduction is fine, but complete obfuscation feels terrible because it lacks counterplay. Ocean fog, especially with storms and/or nighttime can reduce visibility by 90%. Maybe dial that back to 80% so it's still extremely dangerous and realistic, but so that you aren't completely ruined if you happen to bad rng roll this weather while sailing back home with a boatload of ore.

Lastly, and this may be unpopular, but another misstep was an update allowing players the ability to fully customize the game's difficulty parameters. Valheim used to stand out more in this genre because it unapologetically staked a claim on what it stood for and the shared player experiences that raised Valheim to its legendary, if not mythical status: 
zones with enemies that will initially annihilate you (remember your first time encountering a troll?), 
dangerous ore harvesting (remember when you wrecked your ore-laden ship while sailing back to base?), 
corpse run-death-loops (remember the first time you died in the mountains or wherever and couldn't get your gear back because you didn't make backup weapons and armor?), 
and seemingly impossible bosses that force you to discover and utilize the counterplay the game provides (remember when bonemass murdered you, but then you made poison resist potions and grabbed a mace?) 

Allowing players to subvert this and do whatever they want isn't freedom; it's anarchy. It marginalizes Valheim's identity and diminishes the shared experiences I just listed. These experiences are what make a game mythical and give that feeling of satisfaction and catharsis in a playerbase. Now, with full customization, Valheim is one thing for some and something completely else for others. There's a more diverse community, but the community itself is less. It's quantity over quality, which I disagree with. Maybe full customization sells more copies, but it tarnishes Valheim's aura, it's mythical status. Instead of being THAT game, it becomes just another game. 
Perhaps there's a middle ground here: if there were just a few difficulty settings like Sandbox, Casual, Pure Valheim, and maybe even a Brutal difficulty mode, this would accomplish the goal of broadening accessibility but without losing what made Valheim ""Valheim"" to everyone who played it on its intended factory settings.",True,Strategy

Valheim,"Review Checklist Linux Edition

This game is great! It's like Ark in a lot of ways but also quite different. And it runs wayyy better. You can even tame creatures but the game doesn't make this known or explain it - Youtube is your friend in a lot of such cases. It can be a bit tricky to understand how to get started at first but your best bet is to start by fixing up one of the existing structures for your starter home before committing to a fully fledged base. The progression is weird in such a way that building the optimal base is not possible until a ways into the game.

My only gripe at this point is - please, please add a secondary destroy option for unwanted items. I don't want to have to use console commands to do this and dropping items on the ground adds unnecessary instances, in addition to accidentally picking them up again. Dropping them in the ocean is an option but if you're too close to your base, they will never despawn.

Valheim,The game is pretty smooth on almost every aspect of the game.  It is a great survival type game with minimal assistance which makes you explore more and figure out on your own.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the building mode.  Took a lot of work to snap things in the correct place.  Overall I would give it a 9/10,True,Strategy
Valheim,"Absolutely worth the money at full price. The mod support is top notch. It can get a bit grindy at times, but there is always a mod for whatever bothers you.

This is an easy 10/10.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"For a little indie game it's quite good if you are into survival base building games you will definitely enjoy it. It's become one of my all time favorite survival games after 800+ hours on 5 different playthroughs. Some of the biggest pros the game offers is it's massive randomly generated seeds. Every time you go into a seed it feels fresh because of how random everything is you get the feeling that you are adventuring and finding something unique. This is a feature that is done very well in this game most of these survival games get very stale after a play through or two so this feature keeps it interesting. Another big pro this game offers is it's rewarding progression system. Every time you go into a new biome you will run into a lot of issues especially when you are a new player. The enemies are much tougher the weather is much harsher the terrain is more brutal and harder to navigate etc. But by grinding/gathering and slowly making your way deeper you will slowly conquer the area that you once found terrifying at the beginning with ease. Another thing I liked a lot about this game is there isn't really a real ""path"" you are supposed to take. Outside of Ashlands which is the newest biome you arent really restricted to traveling into a certain direction. You can pick a direction and just go this is one of the best things about this game it allows you to adventure and discover regardless of where you travel initially. Building can be fun and I think Valhiem is one of the harder games to build something and make it look really nice. So if you are able to do that it does feel good and look awesome.

Now some things that the game doesn't do so great and keeps it from being one of my top 10 all time favorite games. The combat is lack luster and clunky. It does slightly improve once you level up skills and have high tier foods but it never truly comes online like some other great combat systems such as Darksouls. It remains janky all through the game even when you are endgame with magic stuff. Like how you aren't able to hit enemies that are on slops or how you cannot use weapons if you are in the water etc these things never get better and imo is not a very good combat system. The game is unplayable without Rested Buff also. There are weird design choices that I personally believe are just bad. Some examples you cannot drink meads to reset buffs until the timer runs out. But at the same time you are able to eat more food after half the time has expired to replenish it's effects. Later in the game you unlock magic there is a staff of protection that gives you a barrier to absorb damage taken. If you recast the barrier spell it will reset the timer of the barrier but it will not reset the Health points on the barrier shield itself. Some would argue that is because the staff is op so they don't want it to be even more op. I call BS, I would argue why even let you reset the timer at all if you are not able to reset the shield health also? What would be the point in resetting the shield timer then? Might as well treat it like the Mead buffs then and make players wait for barrier to either break or for timer to run out completely before being able to recast. It feels like they don't know what they want exactly when it comes to some of their mechanics and systems so it's just random and it doesn't make much sense. Imagine making a game with Vikings and then restricting the player from being able to drink more mead until he has completely sobered. It just doesn't make sense if I'm being honest.

These are some of the few gripes that keeps it from being 10/10 masterpiece for me. But overall it is still one of my favorite games.",True,Strategy

Satisfactory,"I played a TON of this game in Early Access on EGS. Stopped right before they added nuclear power. Jumped back in at 1.0 and now I've got a problem. I finished my first playthrough at ~650 hours. I'm now over 100 hours into my second playtrough, and I just started making screws. I have never been this addicted to game in my entire life.

That form can equal function is the number one thing that keeps my brain engaged with Satisfactory. I am a systems-thinker. Since I was a kid, I've always been into systems designs. First it was roads, highways etc that kept my mind busy. Later more complex systems like modular synthesizers etc. Satisfactory lets me play with systems, and I just see endless possibility. 

My perfectionist brain constantly scours my designs to find inefficiency. I'll look over a iron plate layout, realize I could make it 2x faster, then spend the next few hours making it so. Once I'm overwhelmed with numbers, I just switch to designing aesthetics for my factory.

And now, Satisfactory has risen to that level of incredible enjoyment. I just completed all the milestones in the game, and those 351 hours were immensely satisfying (yes, the game's name couldn't be more appropriate). V1.0, which I started in, is a masterfully crafted environment that was stunningly beautiful, intriguingly challenging, perfectly balanced, and just a blast to live in. The decisions that were made by the developers regarding all aspects of the game were extremely impressive. I could go on and on... just get it, just play it, and you will absolutely love it.",True,Strategy
Satisfactory,"A Good 3D Factory builder and competitor to Factorio (another game I invested a lot of time in.)

I've been playing this game before the original release which means I experienced Mercer Spheres and SAM ore when they weren't usable at the time. It's good that they have a purpose now.

Just by looking at my play time and taking the time to optimize the factory layout while unlocking milestones and technologies, this game can be pure addiction. Even with unlocking the special mechanics from the MAM terminal it made a whole lot easier to use things like Mercer Spheres, Somersloops, etc.

If you like exploration, sandbox but also creativity and optimization construction, then this game is for you and all Factorio players.",True,Strategy
Satisfactory,"Really fun and immersive factory sim. Great first person perspective to get a close up look at things. Cool exploration, great progression systems, and interesting story to ground everything. As far as sandbox sims go, this one is really well executed.",True,Strategy
Satisfactory,"Satisfactory is all about efficiency, planning, and making the most out of limited resources. The fun starts immediately, with rapid progression in the early game. You’ll quickly set up miners, belts, and production lines, only to realize that the next upgrade requires a ridiculous amount of resources—forcing you to either expand or just stand around waiting.

The real magic happens when you scale up. Massive power plants, intricate belt systems, and logistics that make your head spin—this is where the game shines. Building is smooth, and working with friends makes the whole experience even better. You can divide work, optimize production, and solve power problems together. Sure, sometimes there are connection issues, but that’s just life.

Exploration? It’s there, but it’s more of a necessity than a focus. You’ll hunt for power slugs (some easy, some painfully hard to reach), but the world itself doesn’t drastically change as you move across the map—it’s just different scenery. What really matters is where the ores and water are because having to travel for basic adjustments is a pain.

Conveyor belts are solid, though they can get clogged with unwanted materials, which is annoying to fix. Power management, on the other hand, is one of the best mechanics in the game—you're always pushing for more, and finding new ways to generate it is super satisfying.

Now, my biggest gripe? The lack of variety in resources. There’s one main ore that’s used in almost everything, a secondary one that’s kinda important, and the rest are barely relevant. More ores, more recipes, and more ways to create new things would take this game to the next level. Right now, progression mostly just builds on itself instead of branching into new areas.

One last thing—this game is a beast when it comes to performance. If you’re planning to play it for the visuals, be warned. You’ll need a strong graphics card, because even on the lowest settings, weaker PCs will struggle.

Overall, Satisfactory is an incredible factory builder with deep logistics, great multiplayer, and endless optimization potential. But it could use more variety in crafting and a smoother late-game experience. If you love efficiency, planning, and automation, this game will hook you for hours. Just make sure your PC can handle it.

Satisfactory is the game that makes you wonder if you’ve accidentally become a robot. A really, really stressed-out robot who’s trying to build a factory the size of a small country, but with absolutely no idea how to make a cup of coffee.

This game starts out innocently enough. You land on an alien planet, and your mission is simple: Make stuff. And then, before you know it, you're designing conveyor belts that could stretch from one end of the galaxy to the other, all while desperately hoping no one walks by your screen and asks what you're doing with your life.

There’s a certain magic in Satisfactory. A magic that starts when you realize you’ve accidentally created a factory complex so large it can only be described as a dystopian nightmare of pipes and belts. The moment you think you’ve “finished” your factory, you realize you’re just getting started. Oh, you wanted to build a simple iron refinery? Sure, let’s throw in 18 levels of scaffolding and over-complicated assembly lines! We need 9000 megawatts of power, but hey, why not add an extra 10 just for fun!

And let’s talk about the animals. They’re mostly harmless, except when they’re charging at you like an angry rhino after you dared to build a factory in their backyard. I guess I don’t mind that much – they’re just upset because I’ve turned their lush home into a sprawling industrial complex. I’ll just continue my mission of creating, while avoiding being eaten by an angry alien deer thing.

The best part? The game doesn’t even hold your hand. Nope. It throws you into the deep end, lets you figure out how to power your entire factory, and then just stares at you with a blank, alien stare when you start crying about running out of fuel for the third time.

In conclusion: Satisfactory is a game that rewards your obsession with optimization, fuels your addiction to creating over-the-top conveyor systems, and gives you a deep sense of pride when you finally manage to power an entire factory with nothing but biofuel, crushed dreams, and the faint sound of the distant screams of my character as they fall into the abyss.

Satisfactory,"Much more than a just a ‘satisfactory’ experience, I definitely see why this game is so highly acclaimed.  It combines the now-ubiquitous crafting of the survival genre with an almost idle game/cookie clicker sort of progression, kept fresh and engaging by your ability to tweak and optimize your production.  

The game starts off simply, hooking up mining extractors to simple resources and conveyor belts to basic Constructors, but soon enough you'll find yourself sprinting around your industrial sprawl, running up and down various belts, chaining together increasingly-intricate systems to produce ever more complicated parts.  How do you manage your byproducts?  Do you have enough energy production to build a new Manufacturer?  Should you overclock this new Factory or that old Power Plant?  Do you optimize by increasing the amount of resources you’re providing or by decreasing the time it takes for them to get where they’re going?  

In addition to the core gameplay of building a giant industrial system for the purpose of providing resources to an enormous space elevator, there are some fun, light RPG elements as well, with equipment you can upgrade or improve, strange alien resources to analyze, and a surprisingly pretty, surprisingly huge sandbox world to explore.  There are also hostile alien creatures and environmental hazards that you'll need to circumvent or overcome as you roam farther and farther afield in search of new, high-end resources.

I was also very pleasantly surprised by the writing.  Although generally it's just you, the FICSIT Engineer (and maybe your friends if you're playing co-op), alone on a big planet, you get regular guidance from ADA, your Artificial Directory and Assistant, a disembodied computerized voice with a very Portal-esque sense of humor: dry wit and sarcasm, mixed with dark humor and a healthy dash of the over-the-top and absurd.  It’s a tough line to walk, and it might not be quite as sharp as Portal, but it’s a very worthy attempt.

The factory part of it is great. It's complex, has several possible outcomes and paths you can take, and the best part is the freedom of everything about the game; the very open developers (""https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeStainStudios"") who openly listen to the community for changes and are determined to make the game as fun as possible for anyone, and the insane builds you can reference from others who have 10 times as much time played as I do. If I could give it a star rating out of 10, it would be 10, no questions asked. 

However, there are downsides (not many). Firstly, if you are not good at planning things out, you will probably have a very difficult time starting the game. It's slow; very slow in the beginning. You will probably spend 20 hours just to get to tiers 4 and 5. Building can be slow, as you can only zoop or vertically zoop by a max of 10. It's justifiably slow. Pretty much a lot of the game is what I'd call ""slow progression."" 

However, they curated a modding community (""https://ficsit.app""). This community has created several mods like ""https://ficsit.app/mod/InfiniteZoop,"" which fixes the limiting zooping features of the game, and ""https://ficsit.app/mod/FasterManualCraftingRedux,"" which allows you to craft faster. You, as the buyer of this $40 game, can easily make the game work for your preferences, whether you want it to be fast, slow, or in between. It's a complete open book. And it's super easy to install and use (literally took 5 minutes to set up WITH mods and everything).

So, are you willing to play the ultimate brain breaker of a game? Because it really is something special.

",True,Strategy
Satisfactory,"This is one of those games where i wish steams reviews weren't binary as i would probably go for a neutral but given the binary choice i would lean towards recommend.

The game is beautiful, generally well done (with a few distinct bugs), has some sort of narrative which is quite funny and provides a lot of scope for creativity, whether it is simply in building things or how you deal with other puzzles such as finding the numerous collectables or dealing with hostile creatures.

When dealing with hostile creatures you can run away, get them to chase you then run back quickly to collect whatever you are after while they far away, fight them, run them over with vehicles, build a quick wall to stop them shooting at you or so they can't see you or knock up a quick building which cages them in forever or turn off hostility if it really isn't your thing.

The reason i am more neutral is the end game essentially consistes of slapping down hundreds of the same thing and then waiting a number of hours for the requisit number of items to be produced.

While the game does have a narrative it is really just some guidelines of a 'reason' and really it is essntially a sandbox game where you create your own goals. 

It is interesting that the game is quite complex, but considering automation is the core principle it is also tedious and frustrating without mods as troubleshooting a production issue when you have a production line spread through potentially hundreds of machines spread over multiple floors and possibly numerous locations/factory sites can be extremely tedious and often comes down to something silly like a tiny part of a conveyor belt has not been upgraded.

Luckily the modding community seems very good and mods are easy to install/manage. Mods solve many of the lacking issues with the game but particulalrly with troubleshooting usuall only guide you to the general area of the problem and it can still be time consuming to figure out where the actual problem lies.

One of the unispiring aspects of the game is essntilly the requiremnet to use websites such as satisfacory tools to be able to effectively plan and build any prooduction line/factory. You can start the game building creatively but production lines soon become so complex you need to use some sort of planner to build effectively without having to rebuild constantly as you realise something doesn't fit or you need more of them etc. This is all fine until you realise all your really doing is puting the end product into a website and then repetitively putting down the couple of hundred production buildings it says you need and then connecting them up.

I basically got to a point where i looked at what i had to build and felt it was just a grind and there wasn't any real challenge creatively or gameplay wise as i could easily avoid any eneimes and accessing any collectables was no longer a challenge and really i was just collecting them to pass the time while my production lines made the requisit number of required items.

If i didn't have other games i wanted to play i could probably spend thousands of hours playing Satisfactory and i probably will start over again at some point although i suspect it may be one of those games you perpecually start over as the early game is fun and interesting but after a certain point you don't feel inspired or driven any more.",True,Strategy

There is a lack of late game travelling aid, like a drone to reliably fly around to collect items with (somersloops/mercer spheres/ hard drives).  @CoffeeStainStudios wheres our personal drones at??? Common, we can build a nuclear facility and have drones deliver things, but we cant have our own flyable drone to get around around more easily than using jetpack/running or tube cannons at bases in the late game?? PSHHH. 

✔ Highly addictive 
✔ Play messy or OCD heaven
✔ Creative elements 
✔ Beautiful open world 
✔ Great milestone system to familiarise players with logistics mechanics
✔ Difficulty to each phase is scaled perfectly, once a complex idea is now minor setup for bigger systems.

✖ Vehicles need to be more useful, especially late game for fast travel, instead of relying on tube cannons or super late game things like the portals (which are hella expensive).

_________________________________________

This game already has overwhelming positive as a rating, but figure with the impact it has had, I will review anyway.

I've been to the end of games, which never really left such a lasting impact as this one.  I think it was mostly because of how daunting the concept of this game is - or was at first.  Its very technical, lots of numbers/math and planning.  Odd as it is for someone like myself, a creative non-analytical person, this game was extremely 'satisfying.'
As said, it is daunting at first, but exponentially becomes 'easier' in its concepts, and more of a planning game than something you need to get your brain around.   You can build as needed, or go mass monster and make mega factories.  Personally, I only did what I needed, had fun being creative, and enjoyed each step of the way without being bogged down by grinding. You were always moving forward in each step, building towards something.  This game really does hold true to its name, it is very satisfying. Each milestone feels earned and is within reasonable reach, most of all, you have a sense of accomplishment. Especially when you complete the game. As I just did moments ago. I am now elated and have that all too familiar feeling like when you finish a tv show. What do I do now?  I spent so much time, I now have that time to do other things.  Time to pick up another hobby or something while I take a break from gaming to refresh real quick hah! 
 

I give this game 9.5/10 - and knowing there is more content to be added, more building utility to come, I am now going to take a much needed break.  This is a game I am absolutely going to come back to later, and with all the knowledge I built from getting 100% completion (game and achievements), I will do much better next time. Mostly likely play on a server to do some mega builds with some friends.  Solo is great, but co-op I believe is where the main attraction is, you could really get a lot done and be more effective as a team, I am sure. 

______________________________

Why the .5 missing to make 10/10?  My only gripe with the game, exploration. At first, cool, its a beautiful world. But later in the game, when you NEED to sloop everything or get all hard drives...  It is monotonous/boring.   It can tear you out of the immersion, for me at least, and its unnecessarily hard to get around in late game.  Seriously Coffee Stain, where are our drones to fly around in??  Rocket fuel jet pack does okay, but I mean common, late game you should be able to unlock a means of getting around VERY easily. Not relying on the tube canon trick to launch you. No, we need a vehicle in late game that allows us to fly around, and quickly get to where we need to go.    

BUT as said, this is only minor, an incredibly small part of the game, and only became a real issue when I was collecting achievements, i.e. getting 50 somersloops, or 100 hard drives, etc.  You can definitely make this easier on yourself if you do it while you play from the beginning, but most wont know ahead of time to do that.  I only really needed those items toward mid-late to late game. So there was A LOT of running around to do to get machines slooped to churn out items to hit that 1k coupon trophy, the famous Golden Nut.

Alas, folks. Get the game, the studio is amazing. Great interaction with us through their development stages, listened to feedback, delivered when they needed too. Other studios need to take note. I hope to see more from them, they made a gem of a game. Something I will definitely do multiple play-throughs during the years of being a gamer.

Satisfactory,"Satisfactory is a game that strikes a perfect balance between sandbox and strategy. It's a game that let's you feel like you've done so much, and yet your final objective is still so far out of reach. It makes you want to keep coming back day after day to take a few more steps towards that finish line.

In online forums, this this game is often referred to as ""digital crack"" due to it's ability to suck you in despite it's innocuous appearance. I disagree.

This game is like crack in the sense that you become addicted to it and it ruins your life. The devs are aware of this; they added a notification that pops up every 2 hours, suggesting you to take a break. Each successive message has more urgency than the last, begging the player to shut the game off and step away. But the factory must grow. It needs to grow. I don't know what to do if I don't make it grow.

Often times, when I've played for multiple days in a row, I start to see the factory in my dreams. I see the items, I see the numbers. I draft floorplans and machinery and weave a tapestry of conveyor belts in my mind. I wake up - my factory is inefficient - it must be dismantled and rebuilt, bigger, better.

This is the single greatest folly one can make in this game. Once you've stared long enough into the abyss that is the late-game, you cannot wipe what you've seen from your memory. It hangs in your vision constantly, like a spot in your eyes from looking at the sun. Every new game you start you will be aware of your inadequacies; how feeble your factory is now compared to what it must be down the line. You attempt to future-proof your design, maximizing output from resource wells and balancing each machine to a perfect clock speed for maximized output. You find a harddrive with an alternate crafting recipe - your factory is inefficient. It can be better. It has to be better. Tear the whole thing down and start over-

No.
You've lost your mind.

Satisfactory,"TL;DR: It's a fun time sink.
Play for 4 hours without mods.

My thoughts:
It's a fun game where the main goal is to gather resources and craft the next tier's super doohicky, which requires 200 of the previous doohickeys and takes twice as much time to make.

You'll find yourself progressing and then either having to rebuild everything, or start another factory, due to new unlocks. (Either more efficient recipes, or needing 10x the throughput for the next step.)

The process for updating everything is contrived and time consuming, so personally I rather just migrate to the next compound and salvage anything worth saving.

I know that sounds rather overly critical, however I actually enjoy some of that aspect of the game, as you become familiar with the game and it's mechanics you start improving your designs and overall understanding of the game loop, and by forcing you to either redo or move the game allows for the player to grow and experiment.

Now, I do have some serious grievances however:

1. End game is boring, as everything's cost grows exponentially and takes exponentially longer to craft.
2. Combat is an absolute slog, and honestly I wouldn't blame anyone disabling it. I feel like it's only tolerable when exploring, and even then its still so clunky and janky. 
(I admit I'll never get tired of the spinning ragdolls)
3. The pace for unlocking traversal tools is odd, with some real head scratchers.
4. The lack of physics for buildings can be very jarring, and while I understand it can end up acting as a very time-consuming chore, I feel like this game could have easily implemented at least something to prevent me from casually laying down a one wall tower to the heavens with platforms to every major biome.
5. There's a semblance of a plot, and an interesting side plot about aliens. It doesn't matter.
6. The environment antagonizes you exclusively. Nothing damages buildings vehicles, and you don't need defences. (WHY NOT?!)
7. The map is static, meaning there's very little replayability once you're familiar with it.
8. Biomes don't matter much, with very few traits being unique to each biome. (How buffs / debuffs like having temperature impacting machine efficiency?
9. Slugs/somerloops/Mercer spheres are great fun to find, quite useful and offer varying levels of challenge, but don't seem to scale well, and end up losing value relatively quickly.

Destiny 2,"10 year veteran of the franchise. this new season brings to me the unfortunate realization its over. the game had the most amazing expansion in its history, just to turn around and fire loads of staff. bungie vets who made this series what it is (was practically) are gone, and you can feel it. new season with no exotic armor at all, mediocre activity that is just the same recycled event, with recycled modifiers from older content that is extremely tiring, just cus it worked once doesnt mean they need to do it 3 or so times. the sandbox is in a pretty great state, but the creativity of the team is dying out, and the lack of employees and budget is extremely obvious. Pete Parsons is directly responsible for cutting hundreds of devs and bringing this ship crashing into the ground. Destiny is genuinely unenjoyable and within the hour i was bored. this is genuinely depressing as i have thousands of hours, and thousands on psn and have loved the game through some of its lowest points. but the mediocrity of this season is killing me. i genuinely am worried this game will actually die for real within this act.",False,Strategy
Destiny 2,"[code]While Destiny 2 offers satisfying gameplay experiences, memorable story moments and a stellar presentation in terms of art direction and soundtrack, it unfortunately devolved into a “you had to be there”-kind of MMO, that is incredibly unwelcoming to newcomers: A baffling amount of removed content, time-limited story events and lots of microtransaction needed to access the “full game” should make you think twice about getting into Destiny 2.[/code]

I started my personal journey with the [i]Destiny[/i] franchise all the way back in June of 2014, when the original [i]Destiny[/i] released. I still remember firing up my PlayStation 4 on launch day, my excitement when joining many other players as newly awakened Guardians. After starting out in the Cosmodrome on Earth, I’d travel all over the solar system to fight for the fate of humanity in PvE encounters – or against fellow guardians in PvP matches (thank you, Hawkmoon). Since I was also playing through each of the four expansions when they released, I soon racked up way over 500h of playtime - and while the original [i]Destiny[/i] definitely wasn’t a perfect experience in many ways, it gave me a lot of fond memories that I cherish to this day.

In 2017, [i]Destiny 2[/i] was released, although in a very different form compared to what the game is like today. First off, while the games only featured time-limited content in the form of special events before, tied to occurrences like Valentine’s Day or Halloween for example, the release of the [i]Forsaken[/i] expansion in 2018 saw [i]Destiny 2[/i] introducing a seasonal model to the game: New additions to the game in terms of story and gameplay, that were releasing between the annual paid expansions, where now tied to “seasons” - with most of this new content apart from your claimed rewards being removed once a season ends. While other MMOs, like [i]Final Fantasy XIV[/i], keep their story (patch) content available forever, [i]Destiny 2[/i] was now requiring players to keep playing if they don’t want to miss out on how the still ongoing plot, that started with the original [i]Destiny[/i], develops. It was at this point that I stopped playing [i]Destiny 2[/i] frequently and only returned for a bit every time a new expansion released, as I didn’t want to be stuck to a game that puts an expiry date on its story content.

Unfortunately, in retrospective, this would only turn out to be the beginning of the horrid relationship that [i]Destiny 2[/i] has with its older content. After going free-to-play with the release of the [i]Shadowkeep[/i] expansion in 2019, which didn’t mean much as you still had to pay for past and future expansions, the year 2020 and the [i]Beyond Light[/i] expansion brought what many players consider to be most problematic change in the history of the entire game:  The “vaulting” of [i]Destiny 2[/i] content.

To cut it short, over time [i]Destiny 2[/i] removed earlier campaign content from the game, which includes the original “Red War” campaign as well as those from the [i]Curse of Osiris[/i], [i]Warmind[/i] and [i]Forsaken[/i] expansion. Notably, this does not only include the campaign missions but entire locations like Mars, Mercury, Titan, etc. as well. They’re simply gone, with no way to currently experiencing them again apart from watching old playthroughs on YouTube. While they could [i]potentially[/i] return one day, it hasn’t happened for the campaigns at this point, and I think it’s fair to say they never will. While the entirety of the original [i]Destiny[/i] remains online and playable, there is no an incredibly large gap between the last events of the game and the currently playable events in [i]Destiny 2[/i] – not only in terms of the already time-limited seasonal content.

While the intro experience has been redesigned according with the “vaulting” of campaigns, frankly, even as a veteran like I am it’s a miserable experience trying to keep up the story, with so much content vital to the overall narrative removed. Sure, you could resort to dozens of YouTube videos to figure out the missing links, but this is something that a (new) player shouldn’t have to do – while [i]Destiny 2[/i] does offer a dedicated recap page with very brief descriptions in order to keep you in the loop, it obviously can’t replace the experience of playing through the content by yourself. As such, while the latest [i]The Final Shape[/i] expansion might’ve concluded ten years of storytelling to a certain degree, it still feels like the last pages of a book that had entire chapters ripped out from, with the missing information only being available through second-hand reports from other readers.

That said, [i]Destiny 2[/i] sure likes to take money for the older content is hasn’t yet vaulted. While diving into details here would unfortunately take too long, I just want to point out that the “Legacy Collection” and even the biggest “Light & Darkness Collection” bundle doesn’t somehow include full access to all available content in [i]Destiny 2[/i] – as they’re missing the dungeons from the [i]Witch Queen[/i] & [i]Lightfall[/i] expansions. It also feels incredibly ironic to still sell the [i]Forsaken[/i] expansion at a price of 19,99€, since much of the content in the expansion got vaulted, including the campaign – which means it’s just access to a few weapons, a dungeon and a raid now. Did I mention that seasons also offer a premium battle-pass for sale, including buyable tier skips?

While I haven’t yet talked about the absolute disaster that is the [i]Destiny 2[/i] PvP experience, which is incredibly punishing for new players, or the amount of pop-ups, intro-missions and cutscenes you receive when starting up the game for the first few times, by now it should be clear that [i]Destiny 2[/i] is almost outstandingly bad at introducing new players to the game – or at reintroducing players who have been absent for a longer time. This is especially infuriating because below all these aggressively unfriendly design decisions, there is an incredible game hiding.

I absolutely love the gunplay of the franchise for example, fighting against the various enemy factions is usually extremely satisfying. Some of the highest-rarity guns (“exotics”) have become my favourites across all the first-person shooters I have played, be it through their unique effects or great look. In general, the art direction and soundtrack of the franchise is incredible, which makes the ”vaulting” of old locations even more painful, as some beautiful sights are now lost to time. Finally, tackling even the toughest challenges with a group of friends can make for extremely memorable experiences – I still vividly remember the excitement after finishing my first raid, for example.

Still, despite all the greatness that [i]Destiny 2[/i] can offer – which it once again proved with its latest expansion - it’s unfortunately the type of MMO that’s best-described as a “you had to be there”-experience, since it’s painfully bad at allowing new players to catch-up with the long-playing veterans. While not impossible, getting into [i]Destiny 2[/i] requires a certain amount of work that’s understandably deterring to a lot of players – if I were to start out with the game as it is now, I probably would’ve quit the franchise after a few hours or so. Even while [i]Destiny[/i] remains a good starting point if you got a PlayStation/Xbox available, the narrative gap that follows now is likely going to be too large for most players. Hopefully, the franchise can get a fresh start one day, with a [i]Destiny 3[/i] that is once again welcome to all kinds of players, old and new.",False,Strategy

The weapons do feel nice, if it isn't constantly overshadowed by screen shakes, wizard bubbles, freezes, hydras, minotaurs, the list really goes on and on. Almost every enemy in this game has some way to make your character violently shake and it gets sickening after awhile. 

The story is nice, but all the seasonal story goes away every expansion, so you still get content you paid for taken away and the remedy offered is disjointed missions, lore books and ""go watch a youtube video"".

The games mechanics and playlists are progressively growing more and more hardcore, with dungeons slowly turning into 3 man raids. Its not really a bad thing, but a decent enough portion of the community is very elitist about who joins and has done what. There is a smaller amount of very good and nice players though, that try to sherpa new lights often, they are genuinely the traveler's chosen.

There is active work to make PvP not insufferable, but its probably not ever going to have a wide appeal until peer to peer matchmaking is removed and something is done to help new players.

Basically I missed buying a DLC and found out I could do basically as much as a free player. I was €300,-+ in and couldn’t play most of the things available. I could’ve bought the DLC, but it just clicked with me that it doesn’t matter. Because if you don’t buy the next DLC, you’re nothing more than a free player again. The content itself took longer to be done even though it got worse as well. It was clear to see Bungie lost its way and marketing people had taken over the company. 

And it’s really sad because some of my most fun gaming memories are beating Crota’s end, Vault of glass or King’s fall with friends. Getting the Icebreaker, Touch of Malice, etc. Doing missions a special way to get an exotic. 

Those days are long gone.",False,Strategy
Destiny 2,Honestly loved the game joined when forsaken released quit when forsaken was removed. Everything about the game screams content but then you realize that's just because they deleted the previous stuff or you haven't spent enough money to be strong enough to do anything in the game. Bungiee you were cool for forever but its time that this company died and the workers who are worth a damn get separated from the ones who aren't.,False,Strategy
Destiny 2,"I've put a lot of hours into this game yet these days it feels more like a sunk cost fallacy than anything as the reason I continue to play. 

The gameplay is some of the best I have seen from an fps and it's fun to just run around shooting things then disintegrating more with abilities. However beyond the fun gameplay (for the most part) lies a gameplay loop, monetisation practices and such that are absolutely abhorrent.  

Destiny 2 these days is a game that banks heavily on FOMO and 'Engagement' or making sure you're playing it for as long as possible. For one all story in this game prior to the Shadowkeep expansion is gone, The Red War, Curse of Osiris, Forsaken, all gone. They have 'timeline' missions as a pretty bad attempt to inform what happened but you're probably batter off grabbing some popcorn and watching a multi hour story summary if the story prior to shadowkeep is important to you.

The seasons (or now called 'episodes') in this game only last for a year and then disappear from the game entirely including gear save for collecting it randomly when that seasons exotic mission gets added to the roulette along with all the others. This includes the story and some of the story beats are important to the story at large so if you miss it before you get a chance to play it you will again need to look up videos for the story after it gets 'vaulted'.

One of Bungie's biggest blunder imo of recent has been the removal of crafting for seasonal weapons which was introduced to the game in the Witch Queen expansion, it was a system that took some of the pressure off of those who didn't want to mindlessly grind for hours for a good weapon roll. However as of the start of the Revenant episode, they have done away with those so now rng grinding is king again, pandering to the people who love that sort of thing like the Destiny content creators and people who can stand to play this game for hours on end.

They speak of 'catchup' crafting system but they have yet to elaborate on this and I'm one to take it with a grain of salt given their history.

Another big one is how they deal with monetisation. Dungeons in this game used to be things that came with the expansion itself (or at least with the season passes) but at some point in the past they decided to start selling the dungeons separately from the seasons and the only way to get access to them is to either buy a 'dungeon key' or buy the expansion with the added 'annual pass' that includes all seasons plus dungeons which costs about double of what the expansion on its own costs.

The Eververse store is Destiny's premium currency store and has tons more to try and tempt you into spending real money like weapon skins, glamours, shaders/dyes and the like.

Holiday events are notorious as well with added 'event cards' that cost about 15 AUD along with special glamours that cost 22.50 aud based on the silver purchasing prices unless you bother to save enough bright dust in which they each cost 6000 bright dust. The events themselves are just general copy and pastes of the previous years with maybe a few new additions and is just more grinding mostly.

Then there is the bugs, and oh boy it's not Bethesda levels of bad but it can be bad from missions bugging out to abilities not working as they should to even episode gameplay systems not even working as they should. Worst thing is Bungie tends to usually drag their feet about it though given the amount of people they have lost over the last year or so it's not really surprising.

Destiny 2 is like the ultimate love/hate relationship I have for any game with things I like about it but at the same time it is just dampened by so many baffling design decisions by Bungie.

It's my recommendation to not buy this game until Bungie can get it's act together (if they ever do) but if you want to try the game regardless I caution to be careful cause it can become too easy to fall into the same sunk cost fallacy trap me along with many others have fallen into.

I only pray that the Apollo expansion fixes a lot of the issues that Destiny has.

These last couple of episodes have you just doing the same activity over and over again. No strikes or anything like that. It's like 1-2 activities over and over again. Then they keep adding resources into the game which makes progression boring and repetitive. The only way to continue the story is by getting these stupid resources and making stupid tonics. Then they bring back a fan-favorite location just to cut it down and not give you the whole place from D1. It seems like they only want your money and not to make the game fun anymore. There have been so many bugs in the game that still haven't been fixed. They don't care anymore. Plus all of the layoffs at Bungie don't help at all, also from what I have read, it's almost impossible for new players to get going in the game. One last thing, I hate the whole revive token system they have in the game. I think it ruins the whole game mode or strike. Oh no, we are out of revives so now I just have to sit here and wait for a checkpoint or for them to finish the activity. That is so dumb. Oh, and they also put that crap in raids. I will never do a raid in D2 with this system in place. Also, they have brought back classic raids from D1 and have destroyed them with new mechanics that just ruin the whole raid. Oh and if you don't revive the player that went down in time, it's a complete wipe and you have to start that encounter all over again.

Destiny 2,"I've played Destiny 2 since its beta and have bought all the DLCs, even those that became free and eventually deleted. I love the game and I always will. I will still play the game until it gets shutdown or until there's no more content, but I can't recommend this game to anyone, especially to new players and for returning players to spend their time elsewhere. There's a plethora of issues, issues that I initially thought about putting in this review, but only to decide that the poor decisions Bungie made aren't going to be fixed or reconciled with so what's the point in reiterating them. If you're curious, I can only suggest you do your own research on Bungie's poor decisions such as layoffs and deleting DLCs, how the story is now a jumbled mess that you wont understand unless you've been here from the start, how the experience for new and returning players is a horrid slog, how the gameplay loop is now a boring farm, how content contributes to FOMO, and how the game is a husk of what it once was (just to name a few).

Anyone new seeking a fun game, don't bother with Destiny 2 as the new player experience is a boring slog of information that you'll never understand unless you've been here for all of it before. A gameplay loop of struggling to climb a ladder only to be met with a community rarely accepting those who don't know how to play the game. There's so few new players that you won't be able to play a lot of the endgame content for 2 reasons. The first being that rarely do old players wanna play with someone who's new to a lot of the content, especially older content, so older players will either kick you or ignore you. The second being that all the older players aren't playing old content to begin with, but instead the newer content, so you'll have a tough time finding players for old stuff. Older content really benefits from new players, but because the new player experience is so poor, you'll be left out of a lot of the game if you somehow stick around.

For anyone returning, seek another game as the returning experience will have you feeling empty at the lack of content available or understanding for what's happening now. Miss a couple seasons and now you're wondering ""why are we friends with the Cabal/Fallen?"". The only people who benefit from the game in its current state are those who have been here from the start, have been on every day/week, have played all the content, who have stayed up to date on everything. Many of the issues new players face, returning players will face too. Destiny 2 is not what it once was so if you're returning, wanting to experience nostalgia, you're bound for a poor time.

I will say, however, despite the numerous flaws the game has, it can be fun with friends, but only for a limited amount of time. If you wanna just shoot stuff and farm for gear, it isn't the worse, but better options still exist. Bungie has made a ton of poor decisions that have ultimately made Destiny 2 a dying cash cow for them as it's their only successful product that will inevitably shutdown. It just won't last as long as many of us would hope for and it's nothing like what it was when it first released. The sense of admiration and love from its release is gone.",False,Strategy

Destiny 2,"Do I recommend this game? Yes and no. If you want a game that you can grind for hours and hours upon end to get weapons and armors that look cool just to have them sit in a storage, then yes. If you enjoy achievement hunting, collectors items, and playing with your friends just to have fun in FPS games, then yes. 

If you like to experience the story and take in the atmosphere while also having something to do that progresses that said story, then No. Unfortunately, Bungie wants to release DLC for this game that you have to pay for just to take it away a few years later and make it not only unobtainable, but also unplayable if you already bought it. You'll read in other comments that this game is temporary by design. The inability to replay previous campaigns is astonishing to me when their player base buys that content. 

I think that the game is fun, I just dislike that I can't play the campaigns over again just to relive what greatness once was. Imagine being able to go back with your friends and replay the Red War with the new strand or Stasis mechanics. Replaying the old legendary campaign if you weren't able to when it came out. Instead of releasing shitty, not well written stories about new found abilities like strand and stasis then being able to combine at will with the prismatic subclass, maybe we focus on letting the community enjoy the game with the best of the story or just replaying the story to follow the lore once again. Not going to lie, not many people like reading when it comes to playing video games, why not just let the player base experience the lore for themselves and play through the whole story again. 

I know that the main story is over but for now, I am going to have to say no. I don't recommend this game to anyone just for the sake of others wallets. After selling rights to Halo and letting 343i ruin their amazing story line, Bungie only has Destiny 2 to their name. Yet they refuse to put forth the effort in making great content again.

Destiny 2,"New Players:
If you're looking for a behemoth of a shooting game that has some of, if not the best, shooting mechanics, controls and tightness in the industry - there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't download the free to play version of the game and see if you want more. There's complexity in the game play loop, but it's never overwhelming. There's a lot to do, but it's goal oriented. You can quite literally shape your own Destiny. But don't expect the game to hold your hand or to explain the story. Destiny is a consuming game that wants you to invest time in game and outside the game to be truly immersed in it's world.

Returning Players:
As a Destiny 1 beta tester and long time player I took a massive break between 2020-2025. When I came back, I was blown away at how Bungie has solved some of it's core loop issues and how it respects your time so much more than it did before. I may not agree with everything Bungie the company does to make money, but what I can say is the reason you fell in love with Destiny to begin with is here and better than ever. Every single system has improved, from Trials to Vanguard Strikes, Bounties have been somewhat reworked into Pathfinder, which is genuinely rewarding and not just a bunch of chores. It seems to be an infinite source of power from what I can tell, as you can reset your Pathfinder multiple times a week. How you build your character feels like a real RPG. Obviously there is a meta, but with all the investment they've made into subclasses, you have a vast array of options to express yourself as a Guardian in Sol. The Prismatic class is one of the coolest designed work Bungie has done - it's almost hard to believe Bungie was willing to concede that much freedom to the player.

Overall, is Destiny 2 perfect? No. There's still bugs and frustrations and an arguably worse pay model then it was at launch. But it is now currently living up to it's potential of it's game play and core systems and that creates excitement in this old grizzled veteran for the future of the game.

Bungie - as you move forward continue to focus in on the players. If you make the product even better, players will hand you money. I have and I will.

Not only are they constantly putting out and sunsetting content at a breakneck pace, but the game will force you into missions with zero context if you log in after an extended break. You get cutscenes that can't be paused, and long missions that need to be completed in a single sitting. And what if you try to back out or need to quit before you finish? Good luck finding that mission or cutscene again, since they drop you in with no warning and then don't even tell you what the segment was called or where to find it again.

While free, you miss out on a lot of interesting story beats that come with the DLC, abilities, whole weapons and exotics are locked away from you, and the base free game lacks the content enough to sate a purely free player.

My weakness and main reason I've so many hours is mostly due to having played the first game on console [Destiny] since the beta, but the lore and the feeling of sunk cost fallacy keep me tied to it.

Destiny 2,"Definitely buy it on a sale. 

The game unfortunately suffered from a constant decline throughout the years. I've been a big fan of the franchise since D1, so when they fixed with Forsaken I jumped in, and it had a pretty bright future.

Unfortunately, the last few expansions were truly setting the game into a decline. After a long leave from the burnout, I finally got the Final Shape on a sale. The only reason for which it was worth it, is that it did give a few hours worth of content. But I wouldn't go and say it was particularly fun content.

As it stand most encounters feel like a chore to go trough. Destiny decided to crank up its difficulty by making annoyances in the game a constant. 80% fights take place in a tight zones, and the enemies that spawn always slow you, flinch you, disturb your vision, or at the very least somethings is constantly in your face that makes sure you cant see anything, spawn traps, and have absurdly high damage. Covers don't exist as all their abilities are basically created to harass you away from cover.

So the fights basically force you to be on a constant move, while make sure to take away your ability to move properly, or in many cases see where you are going ... hence it doesn't feel like you character is fighting the forces of darkness, it feels more like `you` the player are fighting the game, by trying to like it, but it making it very hard for you to do so.

And story overall is a downer. Years of buildup and suspense ... and it can all be summed up as ""Well some dude(s) didn't really like what the big magic space ball was doing, so they create the exact opposite of the magic space balls was, but this time the preferred shape was the triangle. 

Imagine my shock when, the story concluded with the most generic, by the numbers story beats, a child could come up with ...

And I'm not even going to get into details about the shop. I've accumulated a good amount of special credits, that's not the payed 'special' credit, but the next best thing, but there's nothing for me to buy really, as all cool collaborative stuff are exclusively for premium in-game credit, on top of you already having payed for all content ...

So all in all, if you are bored, and looking for something that will keep you occupied for a good amount of time, and will keep you moderately interested for portion of that time, get it on a sale. Otherwise you are better of doing anything else.",False,Strategy
Destiny 2,"I've been an on and off player since Destiny 1 and I have one word to describe this franchise. Disappointing. That's the story with this franchise taking content we've paid for away, no meaningful gameplay additions, the story since Destiny has been spotty with a few highpoints which have been taken away at this point, the pvp is super unbalanced with only a handful of exotics and builds dominating regardless of skill level, and quite frankly progression since the free to play update is a part time job, you grind one objective for hours then move to the next over and over while some of these things can be fun the first gang of times after you're forced to play the same events, battles, instances and objectives for the 50th time with no change or meaningful conclusion or anything it just makes you feel like you've wasted your time. 

The gunplay is great, the environments are beautiful, and it has cool ideas in all the MMO aspects (classes and such), that's the end of the good. It's free so do whatever is free but don't spend your money here it just goes into a void where Bungie doesn't use it to maintain the game and keep the content you pay for, doesn't use it to pay people to balance the pvp and make it fun, or even give you good quality story content, it just goes to CEO bonus' and shareholders who do dick all and could care less for their dedicated base.",False,Strategy

I decided to give it a shot and bought all of the new expansions just two month later to realize how much I hate Destiny 2. Player base is very low, some quests takes forever to finish, progression system is a total garbage. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you used to frustration and big disappointments.

Destiny 2,"Alright, I originally wrote a pretty negative review. Those thoughts were mainly coming from playing the current season (Heresy). After playing a bunch more, I stick by those feelings. Plenty of people out there saying it's great/refreshing to no longer play the game on god mode but, honestly, taking away something as crucial as healing (in a game that is centred around your character pretty much being a god) is just forcing hard content on people who want to have a chill time. Imagine being a new player and going to that hell hole (in a game that already has terrible new player experience no less)! I wanted to go back to the Dreadnaught & enjoy it from a nostalgic sense, a nice throwback to D1 and the expansion that made that game for me. Going there is literally the last thing I now want to do but we're now stuck with ""hard mode"" for the entire season. Not having a cry that there's hard content as such content already exists in the game and I just avoid. If I want to play the season, though, I can't avoid it. So, I'm missing a season that I already paid for the battle pass for, sweet!

The answer, in the end, was focusing on old content - closing out old exotic quests etc. and finding a group of people to play that content with. Who knows, maybe Bungie will give us a normal season that we can all enjoy next time...

The positives are that the game is well polished and gun play is awesome. The soundtrack is easily one of my favourites. If you could access the whole story, I'd say that the story is awesome too. But you can only access the beginning and the end of the story with huge swathes of great story telling and character development torn out of the middle.

Still leaving a thumbs down because they sunset some of my favourite parts of this game, never to be seen again, and because the level of thought that has been going into the content being delivered to players has been steadily declining. We play in a constantly recycled world.",False,Strategy

Personally I don't have a lot of hope for the future and Destiny is too strong of an IP to not try and develop some next-gen sequel to this game. Luckily this game has aged very gracefully and doesn't feel dated yet. Now that we have come to the end of the originally extraordinarily ambitious ""10 year story"" commitment that Bungie made in 2014 I can honestly say that despite all the ups and downs I enjoyed Destiny and D2 more often than I didn't enjoy it. I guess the grind just got to me eventually doing the same routine on a quarterly cycle just gets old after half a decade I guess. I'm not even going to write a real review about this game. I guess all I really have to say is that its good. Its fun, the music is good, the gun are good, the environments are cool. I don't really even see how you could begin to start this game and enjoy it if you haven't been playing since at least 2019/2020 or so. If you're a solo player idk how you're still playing. You need to experience this game with a group of friends or a clan. I've been very luck to have made real friends through this game. The barrier to entry on the mechanics, story, and economies etc are just so insanely high and that's why we need a reset imo. Something to bring back that charm we all felt in 2014 and 2017. I guess some wishes I have for the future is PVP stops being a constantly neglected shitshow.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"I've been playing since around launch (on console) and I would play this game religiously every day after I was done school for about 5-ish years, playing ranked with friends, being hard-stuck, hell this was the first game I tried to play competitively outside of ranked, but over the years, the questionable decisions by Ubisoft, the game became stale to me. in the golden days (basically anytime before ranked 2.0) this game was a blast, though i cant attest to it being cheater free as i never had played on PC during this time, R6 felt like it was in pretty decent shape even on console. nowadays its plagued with cheaters in champ lobbies (or xim users on console) and half the time they don't even get banned. its honestly quite embarrassing on their end. Not to mention some of the operator additions/changes that were extremely egregious. Maybe I'm suffering from nostalgia but this game is a former shell of what it once was.

This isn't the only example, but it's the most well-known.

Ubisoft doesn't know anything about balancing this game anymore and it really shows. From fast-paced gunfights that rewarded great gunskill to crippled ADS times that created an LMG meta because that's how bad Ubisoft is at handling this IP now.

Don't buy this stinker. Spadez made two really good videos about how terrible the game has fallen from its grace, with the only thing even keeping it on the market being the fact that it has no competition.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Rainbow Six Siege is an intense, tactical shooter that rewards strategy, teamwork, and precision. With a deep operator roster, destructible environments, and high-stakes gameplay, every round feels unique and exhilarating. The game’s mechanics encourage smart plays, communication, and adaptability, making it one of the most rewarding competitive shooters out there.

However, the community can be a double-edged sword. While there are dedicated players who value teamwork, the game is also plagued by toxicity, with frequent instances of teamkilling, trolling, and verbal abuse. This can make the experience frustrating, especially for new or casual players.

The worst part of the game would probably be its community. People are very toxic, and many veteran players are very negative towards the changes made to the game and hate any changes Ubi does to the game.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Rainbow Six Siege: A Fucking Masterclass in Punishing the Wrong People

Rainbow Six Siege is, without a doubt, one of the most infuriatingly broken pieces of shit I’ve ever played. It’s not enough that the game is riddled with bugs, random server fuck-ups, and mechanics that feel like they were programmed by a team of drunk interns—no, Ubisoft also insists on actively punishing players for their own goddamn incompetence.

Let me paint a picture for you. I’m hard-carrying my team of brain-dead trolls who are doing everything in their power to throw the match. Running into enemy gunfire? Check. Team-killing for no reason? Check. Standing in a fucking corner and refusing to play? Check. Despite all of this, I’m single-handedly keeping us in the game, clutching rounds, making plays, and generally being the only reason we haven’t lost. And then? The game fucking crashes.

Not my PC, not my internet—the game itself shits the bed and boots me out. And what does Ubisoft do? Do they let me rejoin? Do they acknowledge that their broken-ass game is at fault? Fuck no. Instead, I get slapped with a one-hour ban for desertion. Desertion?! The only thing I deserted was my fucking patience for this dogshit excuse of a matchmaking system.

And the best part? The trolls? The absolute morons who spent the entire game griefing? They get to keep playing. No bans, no consequences, just free reign to keep ruining other people’s matches. Ubisoft would rather punish someone who actually plays the game than deal with the countless idiots running around making Siege the unplayable hellhole that it is.

This game wants to be an esport, a tactical masterpiece, a test of skill. But in reality? It’s a buggy, unbalanced, grief-ridden disaster where you can drop a 15-kill game only to get fucking banned because Ubisoft doesn’t know how to code a stable game.

Fix your fucking game, Ubisoft. Or at the very least, stop punishing the players keeping this shit alive.

Cookie Clicker,The first 85-90% of the game is a fun and addicting gameplay loop; the last 10-15% is an unbelievably poorly designed and thought-out slog that takes thousands of hours and years of waiting without exploits.,False,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"used to play on the browser back in the day, so figured i'd drop a fiver and support the dev and whatnot.

it's still a fun time, but i don't recommend because it looks like the save system is prone to errors.

i logged in today to find out that the save's been wiped. the latest steam cloud backup available on my account is from a week ago ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ a quick google search shows this is a pretty common occurrence, and looks like folks who are really into this game manually backup their saves by exporting the save.",False,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"very good game, takes a while for 100 percent achievements but autoclicker helps (dont like the grandmas)",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"I can't really say anything negative about Cookie Clicker, especially as it has mod support any complaint someone might have can be fixed with a mod or two, and you can try it for free online IIRC.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"Get this game, It's so worth it to have while you do any work related task on your computer. Very fun for split screening!",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,super fun people say it is boring but is not and good for 5 bucks,True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,The concept is good but I can never recommend a game that gates achievements behind random events.,False,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"First off, I want to say: What an amazing game.
This game offers so much to uncover and do within it's game-play, it is pretty much endless. Price-wise it's decent, but I definitely recommend waiting for it to go on sale before you buy, mainly because it's simply an Idle game and it is 100% free to play online. Just looking at the game one might say to themselves ""This looks a tad boring,"" but after playing the game for just minutes you will become hooked. There are so many little Easter eggs, mini games, upgrades and achievements to unlock and so much fun to be had. Overall I'd recommend this game, and love to play it myself.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"A fun game, but be careful. It is hard to concentrate on anything else since a Golden Cookie might be lurking in the background waiting to be clicked on for a huge bonus. If you want to play another game or watch a movie on the PC, you will also want to alt-tab into Cookie Clicker every so often. If you really like cookies and want to permanently divide your attention, or if you are not a completionist, this has my recommendation!",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"I really want to love this game, I really do. But after 200 hours I feel bored and don't want to play anymore. In fact I should've stopped hours ago. 

Sugar lumps take 24 hours to grow. The fastest way to get them is apparently to max out the garden. But good luck doing that as that's one of the rariest achivements. 

Once you get into the hundreds of trillions of heavenly chips, jusst stop playing. Your production of heavenly chips will never go up past this point and upgrades now cost 100s of trillions of heavenly chips so maybe if your lucky you'll get like one bleeping upgrade. 

The stock market is complete and total BS, so why even use it. 

You will quickly get sick of not being able to buy anything once you are at a certain point in the game. Legacy levels don't help you get further. It feels like the game is unfinished and they never came up with an end game. 

Overall, just play for maybe 100-150 and give up. I wasted a good 50-100 hours expecting more of an end game and there wasn't anything else to experience. You will never get that feeling of ""wow I finished the game."" More like ""I'm done I hate this now, I'm bored."" And yes the whole point is that it's endless but even in something like minecraft(before ya know ender dragon and an ending) you'd be so rich and full of diamonds that you'd feel that sense of pride afterwards. 

The garden is honestly the second worse feature of this game. Plants can take six hours to grow, take forever to mutate and you will never get any real bonuses out of them unless you spend another 800 hours so good luck. Oh and the genius devs decided that you should lose all your plants when you legacy with no upgrade that makes it so they stay. Because god forbid, you could have fun. 

The sugar lump situation. Seriously, one of the most powerful upgrades in the game gives you +5 percent click percentage each level up. problem, you will never level up your crusors to level 20. That will never ever happen in your lifettime, unless you literally let the computer run for the next six months.",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"It starts with one innocent click—then suddenly, you're summoning grandmas, optimizing factories, and making deals with eldritch cookie gods.

What seems like a simple time-waster quickly becomes a full-blown obsession, fueled by a diabolically genius achievement system that keeps you saying “just one more upgrade” until it's 3 AM.

Cookie Clicker,Its a simple play in the background game that's fun to mess with in free time,True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"It just kinda one day, randomly put me on a save file that I've never had. It wiped my ascension history and since you can't get offline earnings without it; and it takes forever to first achieve it, i'm kinda disappointed, it really killed the fun I had playing. Otherwise good game, I have no idea what happened to my file so just be sure to remember to export your save files just in case, it also tends to lag when I have other applications open; however, I am on mac so that's basically a given here anyway. :/",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"Just play this game as a background game, or just a game to play when super bored",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"Game's good, but feel like the achievements are to easy to get. And not much content to do once your done everything. Overall I think the character ""Grandma"" as the community calls her is a very well written character, made me cry the way she sacrificed her life to save my cookie empire. Also can't wait for the cookie clicker movie.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,One of the best idle games ever made. Cookie clicker is just a really nice game to play when you have some downtime or don't want to play something more intense.

Simply the best idle game in existence, a second screen experience that will eat all of your time if you aren't careful.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"This game used to be much more popular, and to be honest, it still holds up to this day. It's very addicting to click a cookie and make as much cookies as possible, and to be honest, it's very fun for a simple game. On the flip side, its very tedious to grind all the achievements unless you are using cheats, and it does get boring after a while. That said, i do think that this game is pretty fun, and it is better than most AFK games.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,I cant wait to become the cookie lord and create multi looping realities of cookies,True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"This game, is absolutely bonkers. It starts so simple and fun, but there is so much depth and fun and weirdness and math that it just become impossible to escape.

I played this game years ago and got INTO it, when I saw it on sale on Steam, I asked myself: do I want to let this evil back into my life? Well. Clearly the answer was yes and I have not regretted it.

The game starts so simple and silly, but leads into what can almost be called a story and lots of subtle, and not so subtle, hints of the cookie world. 

Now. It is a game where you are essentially just watching a number get bigger and it is a time suck, so that is important to know going in. But if you're willing to have some passive goofy fun I would recommend it

After all, there is a reason this game has persisted as long as it has.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,Cookie Clicker is fun to be afk on and see how much cookies you made when you come back. Its overall a good chill game.,True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"I clicked a cookie, and then I clicked it again. A few more times I clicked that cookie and then I just kept on clicking. I bought a building to help my cookie clicking empire, I bought upgrades, I have employees of grandmas you wouldn't believe. Then I started clicking cookies in my sleep, at work, on internet searches of cookies. I started looking in the ""Cookies Needing Clicked"" personals... but do I regret my decision? My answer is simple.

Cookie.",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"Cookie Clicker is an engaging and addictive incremental game with a vast number of achievements to unlock. It initially requires active participation, but as you progress, AFK rewards become available, allowing for a more passive playstyle.

I often let it run in the background while working from home, and it remains entertaining with its charming animations, diverse types of cookies, and quirky grandmas. Additionally, the game offers various mini-games, such as the cookie stock market, which add depth to the experience.

I would definitely recommend Cookie Clicker for its relaxing gameplay and long-term enjoyment.",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"This is, in my mind, THE clicker game. It's simple, but scales at a linear pace. Later it introduces mechanics that spice it up: such as the ascension system. I wouldn't recommend trying to get much farther than a quindecillion cookies, or trying to 100% the game,  because at that point the game really slows down. But apart from that the game is an enjoyable experience. 

I would try out the free web version - which is created by the developer - to see if you like it yourself before committing five dollars to this",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"This game sucks if you dont have a life. If you have a life, it still sucks becuase the gameplay is clicking a stationary object. Sometimes it is farming or doing way too complex buff combos, but this game is braindead. dont get sucked in.

Cookie Clicker,"i got a golden cookie combo that gave me literal years worth of cookies in 10 seconds and that was cool, but i cant use any of the quadrillions of upgrade points it gave me because i'm killing it in the stock market and in the middle of growing a new plant at the same time",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,It's a type of addicting clicker game and it's also nice to have a tab open for it all the time so cookies are always being baked but you can only do that when you have at least one grandma. Overall the game is just good in my opinion.,True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"cookie clicker is a game about clicking a cookie
its simple at first but gets increasingly clamplicated
the late game meta has elaborate strategies to maximize cookie pruduction,
to unlock all the upgrades and achivments
and to uncover the deep lore of the grandmapocalypse,
the krublor dragon and the mystery of the cookie universe
In the beginning you click the cookie - which gets you one cookie
You click again, you've got two. then three.
with fifteen cookies you can buy a cursor that clicks for you making cookies automaticly
So you make more cookies, to buy more cursors, to make more cookies – then for a hundred
cookies, you buy your first grandma.
This kindly old woman performs unpaid labour to grow your cookie business – your cookies
become popular in the neighbourhood , then renowned all over town . Production accelerates
exponentially.
You buy cookie farms to grow cookies, mines to extract cookies from the earth, factories
to produce cookies on an industrial scale.
The cookie economy transforms the world around it – chocolate pollutes the rivers , there’s
an obesity epidemic . But the world is too hooked on cookies to stop – economists say
that “""cookies permeate the economy"", and ""If we start eating anything else, we're all
dead"" ”. Cookie banks start using cookies as currency . At temples, thousands pray to
the Baker in the sky . There is no value, no ideology, and no meaning beyond cookies.
You produce hundreds of thousands of cookies a second, straining the fabric of reality
itself . You build wizard towers and alchemy labs to summon cookies magically, you fly
in shipments from space of cookies from alien worlds.
You open portals to a parallel dimension, taking in millions of cookies per second.
Alien beings and cosmic elder gods come to taste your cookies , and whole cities are
engulfed in transdimensional disaster , but the system can’t stop, it can only grow,
cookies are all we know.",True,Strategy

However, after nearly 80 hours, my save file and all of my hard work have simply dissapeared. This apparently has not only happened to me but many others. Outside of that, great game. However I will have to put it to rest now since I really will not be grinding back to where I was.",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"In the world of video games, the term “action-packed” often evokes images of fast-paced shooters, complex strategy games, and high-octane gameplay that keep players on the edge of their seats. However, one game that defies conventional expectations is Cookie Clicker, a seemingly innocuous, idle clicker game that involves baking cookies. Despite its unassuming nature, Cookie Clicker has had a profound and transformative impact on my life, leading me to adopt new ways of thinking, improve my time management, and build habits that have shaped my personal growth. It’s not just a game about clicking cookies—it’s a powerful reflection of the value of incremental progress, strategic planning, and patience, all of which have translated into my everyday experiences.

When I first stumbled upon Cookie Clicker, I wasn’t expecting much. I thought it would be a simple distraction, a game to kill time during breaks. Little did I know that it would soon become an essential part of my daily routine, providing me with more than just entertainment—it offered life lessons that have deeply influenced my perspective on work, productivity, and personal growth. The mechanics of Cookie Clicker—constant incremental rewards, resource management, and long-term strategy—are surprisingly effective in teaching important skills that extend beyond gaming. While the concept of an idle game where you bake cookies may sound absurd, it has become clear to me that the game’s underlying principles mirror many aspects of real life.

In this essay, I will explore how Cookie Clicker has impacted my life in ways I never expected. From shaping my time management habits to fostering emotional resilience, this game has provided valuable insights that I carry with me into every day. By reflecting on the game’s psychological elements, the skills it has helped me develop, and the unexpected benefits it has brought, I aim to show how a simple idle clicker game has, in fact, changed my life for the better.

Section 1: The Psychology of Incremental Progress
One of the key aspects of Cookie Clicker that drew me in was its reliance on incremental progress. In the game, players click on a giant cookie to earn more cookies, which are then used to buy upgrades that further increase cookie production. This seemingly simple mechanic is underpinned by one of the most fundamental psychological principles in human behavior: the power of small wins.

The concept of incremental progress is powerful in that it taps into a deep-seated human desire for achievement. In Cookie Clicker, every click, every upgrade, and every milestone provides a reward, no matter how small. This constant feedback loop keeps players engaged, ensuring that they feel a sense of accomplishment even during short sessions. For me, this was a revelation. In the past, I often struggled to stay motivated on long-term projects because the results were not immediately visible. Cookie Clicker, with its quick and consistent rewards, helped me understand the importance of small, consistent steps in achieving a larger goal.

Psychologically, this is tied to the concept of “intermittent reinforcement,” a principle from behavioral psychology that explains how unpredictably timed rewards can lead to stronger, more persistent behavior. In Cookie Clicker, although there are constant rewards, some of the most significant milestones—like unlocking a new upgrade or reaching a high number of cookies—are spaced out over time. This unpredictability kept me coming back for more, and, over time, I began to apply the same principle to my real-life endeavors. Instead of waiting for big rewards to validate my efforts, I learned to appreciate the small wins along the way, whether they were minor accomplishments at work or simple improvements in my personal development.

Moreover, the game’s structure taught me that progress is not always linear. In Cookie Clicker, as you progress, you can experience periods where your production slows down, and it may feel like you’re not making as much progress as you’d hoped. This was particularly true when I hit certain milestones and realized that my next big upgrade would require exponentially more cookies. At first, this felt like a discouraging setback, but over time, I learned to appreciate the slower periods as opportunities to reflect and strategize. This mirrored experiences in my own life where progress was not always as fast as I wanted it to be, but instead of becoming frustrated, I learned to embrace the process.

As a result, the psychology of incremental progress in Cookie Clicker has become an invaluable lesson for me. It taught me that success is built on a foundation of consistent, small efforts, rather than waiting for a single, grand achievement. By breaking larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, I was able to stay motivated and build momentum in areas such as work, fitness, and even personal relationships.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"January - I was ready to unalive myself. I just bought this game bc it was on sale. At first, it was just a distraction. But then, I got hooked. The world, the story, the characters... I didn’t expect to care so much. Then it became a reason. I told myself ""I can't leave yet. I have to see what happens next.""

Now it's February. I'm still here. Still playing. And for the first time in a while, I’m glad I stayed because I can’t stop playing this damn game.

10/10, life-changing experience. Would recommend.

If you haven’t played The Witcher 3 yet, do yourself a favor and try it. It’s not just a game. It’s an escape, a journey, a reason to keep going and I guess, sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.

Edit: I get that not everyone will understand, and that’s okay. But just because your experience was different doesn’t mean mine isn’t real. Not everyone processes things the same way. You had to face your struggles in your own way, and for me, this game was something that helped me hold on a little longer.

I don’t really talk about this because I’m afraid of being judged or told I’m just looking for attention. That’s exactly why I don’t reach out to people I know. Truth is, I wish I was just faking it. I wish this was just some cry for sympathy because that would mean I’m not actually struggling. But I’m not looking for sympathy. I don’t want people to feel sorry for me. I just wanted to share something that, in that moment, gave me a reason to stay. And just because I didn’t go through with my plan doesn’t mean I’m suddenly okay, it just means I found something that made staying a little easier, even if just for now.",True,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I never replayed The Witcher 3 after my first playthrough on GOG in 2015, where it was quickly cemented in my mind as among one of the greatest games ever made. The final DLC finishes off the story so beautifully, so completely, that despite absolutely loving the game it always just felt... wrong, to take our boy Geralt out of retirement for another go-round.

But now the wind's howling once again, and with the scent of the next instalment looming on the air, I knew it was time to dust off steel and silver and refresh myself on this landmark favourite.

Well, having just concluded the base game again around 10 years after that first playthrough, I can safely say this remains the case: The Witcher 3 is one-in-a-million, breathtaking in the scope of the incredible RPG experience on offer and astounding in the total consistency of its quality throughout.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? The music, the gameplay, the dialogue, the choice and consequence, the atmosphere, the exploration and worldbuilding... the quests that twist and turn, rarely predictable, always worthwhile... everything combines here to create such a compelling world to inhabit. Few games move so deftly between solving the day-to-day problems of the lowly folk to grand-scale, world-saving, empire-making-and-unmaking stakes.

At launch I felt it had set a new benchmark for grand-scale RPGs, and looking back over the years since, there have still been scarce few contenders to that crown. I can't wait for the next one. In the meantime... I'm heading to Toussaint!",True,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"After dropping this game once on console, and revisiting on steam, I can say from the bottom of my heart that I missed out on a amazing game.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Massively overrated. The controls and the camera movements are clunky. Roach is the worst, worst horse riding experience i had in a video game. Boring NPC's. Loud music was irritating. Even though music can be turned down they should have given an option to turn off music during cut scenes and dialogues. On first try i played for 2 and half hours and quit, gave it a second chance and played for another 5 hours and remembered why i quit the first time. I don't understand why the game gets so much hype and praise. NOT FOR ME.",False,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has a great story, especially the part about Geralt trying to find his sworn daughter, Ciri. The characters are well-designed and memorable, and the dialogue feels a bit hard to understand and also funny at the same time. I definitely liked the multiple dialogue choice and having different outcome based on the dialogue u choose. Visually, the game is stunning, the graphics are great considering it as a very old game. 

Every game i play i am always addicted to its ost or music [ whatever you wish to say ]. This game definitely has some too good soundtrack. My fav one is "" Merchants Of Novigrad "". This one is soo good when it randomly starts playing when u roam around the city Novigrad. There is also one music i dont know the name but it starts playing when we play GWENT in DLC Blood and Wine. As we say GWENT i can say it is the most intresting cards game ive ever played in any in-game activity. It is hard at first but once you get the cards then it will be interesting. 

Although the combat style didn’t fully match my taste, I still found the game very enjoyable and engaging overall. Even if u dont like combat style or any other things related to game , the story will make you play this more and more. The DLC heart of stone is also very good, i liked the story of that dlc though the story felt like a side quest or just a quest , still it was great for me. Still playing the second dlc. 

It’s clear why The Witcher 3 is considered one of the best games in its genre.


Problems i faced:
I did face a lot of fps drop particulary in this game irrespective of the graphics quality. I can play GOT , Cyberpunk and other games with stable fps on medium preset or high and rarely faced fps drops but in Witcher 3 im still facing the issue and i dont like it all.

Horse riding experince is very bad atlest for me...my horse get stucks or mostly stops even when the is no obstacles and the horse often come in between fights with bandits or some random monsters i fight on streets, may be cause of fear level.
 
I will give this game 10/10 .",True,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"A generational masterpiece and arguably the best video game of the 2010s, it stands as a truly remarkable achievement in nearly every aspect that defines an RPG. Read on for my in-depth breakdown of what I love about the game, what I don’t, and everything in between.

[i] (Note: This review is based on my playthrough from December/January 2024/25, with the next-gen update (patch 4.04) and both expansions installed.)[/i] 

[h2]Pros[/h2]

- The Witcher 3 features impeccable world-building and immersion. Many open-world games rely on generic, soulless content to fill their game worlds, but not TW3. From visual elements and countless documents you’ll stumble upon to every little quest you complete, everything contributes to this rich and colorful universe.


- Even 10 years after its release, TW3 is still an astonishingly beautiful game. The natural environments are breathtaking—from the swampy, foggy marshlands of Velen to the green forests and picturesque hills further north, the rocky, windswept isles of Skellige, and all the way to the awe-inspiring, Alps-like mountains surrounding Kaer Morhen. The same goes for major cities and locations, which are packed with details and diversity.


- The dialogues and characters in this game are written to near perfection. You’ll encounter dozens, if not hundreds, of memorable individuals, each with unique, multilayered personalities and agendas. You’ll love them, hate them, and, more often than not, feel sorry for them. Simply brilliant writing.


- The visual design of the characters in this game—both monsters and NPCs—is absolutely flawless, especially for a game of its age. I love all the gritty details and the unglamorous appearance of many NPCs, which makes the world feel more grounded and authentic. Even important characters are designed with noticeable ""flaws,"" adding to the game’s immersive, gritty atmosphere.


- Side quests offer a wide variety of unique stories, ranging from intriguing mysteries to moments of comic relief and everything in between. The quality of quest design is exceptionally high, with almost every quest enriching your overall experience through interesting characters, new locations, and immersive world-building lore.


-  The voice acting is phenomenal, truly bringing every character to life. Quite literally, everyone delivered a fantastic performance, and the casting couldn’t have been more perfect for nearly every role. From powerful emotional expressions to impeccable comedic timing, everything was executed to perfection.


- The soundtrack is otherworldly, perfectly blending Slavic folklore sounds and vocals with epic fantasy elements, resulting in unforgettable masterpieces you’ll find yourself listening to on YouTube years after completing the game.


- I love that the game features a glossary system where you can access all the books and documents you’ve previously read, along with entries on important characters and a special section detailing the monsters and bosses you’ve defeated. It provides both immersion through rich lore details and gameplay support with advice on how to overcome these foes.


- I know the game’s combat is a somewhat controversial aspect, but for me, while relatively simple and basic, it’s still fun and engaging—and at the end of the day, that’s what matters most. If you enjoy straightforward systems, you’ll likely find the combat satisfying.


[h2]Cons:[/h2]

[i] (Note: Keep in mind that this is a game developed in the early 2010s and released in the first half of 2015, so some of the issues I mention might not seem as significant for a game that began development nearly 15 years ago.)[/i] 


- Even after countless patches, the game still has its fair share of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to a notable number of quest-related and game-breaking issues.


-  Geralt’s movement often feels sluggish, jerky, and unresponsive. I understand the intention behind adding feedback to his movement, but for me, it doesn’t quite feel right and can sometimes be rather frustrating.


- Interacting with the environment (using the E button) is unfathomably frustrating. It drives me mad trying to find the right angle for the interaction prompt to appear, and often, it feels borderline impossible. This becomes especially aggravating in tight situations where you have only a small window of opportunity to interact with something.


- You can’t jump during combat, which often leads to situations where you get stuck, can’t reach your target, or can’t move past even the smallest elevation. In general, when the game switches to combat mode, the previously mentioned issues—sluggish movement and interaction problems—become even more noticeable and exaggerated.


- Placing all those treasures in the waters around the Skellige Isles is the only poor world design choice in the game. It adds no real value or quality experience beyond providing extra resources and feels like lazy filler content added when the developers have run out of time or ideas. Unless you’re strapped for cash, don’t waste your time chasing all those question-mark treasures scattered across the ocean.


- Combat against flying creatures is not fun and can be rather annoying. Especially when fighting against a flock of flying monsters.


[h2]Things I would love to see improved in TW4:[/h2]

- I hope they improve the progression system in The Witcher 4. I like the general idea in TW3 of selecting which passives and abilities to activate by assigning them to a limited number of slots. Ideally, this should have encouraged me to experiment with different builds, but instead, I found myself barely spending points in the second half of the game, and only occasionally switching out a few slots.

- I hope there will be a system to better organize books and documents, which may be added to relevant quests and characters, make it easier to search through them, add locations where were they found, etc. It’s great to have them there, but some order and structure is needed.


- I hope The Witcher 4 offers a greater incentive to use non-Witcher gear. Despite the variety of other weapons and armor sets, I found myself exclusively switching between different Witcher sets and investing my resources only in upgrading them.

- I hope that there will be a bigger incentive in TW4 to use the non-witcher gear. Despite there being many other weapons and armor sets, I was only switching between different Witcher sets and spending my resources on upgrading them.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"[H3] A beautifully presented and well-acted RPG, which just didn’t grab my heart. [/H3]

Looking at my notes, you would think I adored The Witcher 3. The quest writing challenged my expectations at every turn, pulling unexpected twists while making logical sense. Every side-story is filled with ‘ah-ha’ moments, leading you down a path before flipping the script entirely. These tales are brought to live with superb voice-acting, with villagers carrying the gruff of a hard-lived life in their words. Characters move around in conversation - a minor touch, yet a laborious one which is seldom seen in full-size RPGS.

The visuals are fantastic too; foliage is dense with considerable draw distance, and each blade of grass casts an individual shadow which sways in the wind. Character models are sharp, and modern lighting methods such as raytracing are included in the next-gen update. I love the colour grading, which adjusts in accordance to the weather and sells the mood of the world.

Yet, I didn’t fall in love with The Witcher 3. The beautiful world is busy with optional content, but it’s just that: busy work. Killing wraiths and destroying monster dens might make for great podcast listening, but the lack of progression associated with these side tasks means the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze. Levelling is slow, which is tolerable, but rarely does it carry worthwhile new abilities. Upgrading your fire spell, Igni, for example, lets you spew a few more flames but that’s really it. The way you interact with your magic doesn’t change or offer any creative use.

And really, I didn’t feel The Witcher 3 encouraged any creativity at all. You’re roleplaying strictly as Geralt, and I would be hardpushed to say there are even ‘builds’. Conversations are mostly linear with few choices on offer, and (in effect) your charisma spell is rarely utilised. Movement feels stiff, and swimming feels like a constant fight against the controls. The game is also filled with glitches. Geralt shrunk down to 4’2 for a large portion of the game; quest characters refused to talk unless I restarted the game; textures would flicker; the game would freeze during loading, and it regularly switched to first-person.

I didn’t feel I could express much creativity within the game, and so it failed to resonate with me. The Witcher 3 is an improvement on its predecessor in nearly every way, and the story is genuinely well-written and even better acted, but I think I have to conclude that the series just isn’t for me.",True,Strategy

A standout feature of the game is its world-building. The scenery is stunning, ranging from battle-scarred towns to thick woodlands and vibrant cities like Novigrad. The side quests are brilliantly designed, frequently incorporating moral dilemmas and surprising twists that render them equally significant as the primary narrative.

In terms of gameplay, The Witcher 3 integrates strategic combat, alchemy, and magic, enabling players to customize their fighting techniques. Moreover, the expansions (Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine) significantly enrich the experience with captivating missions.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"[h2] This game is everything and even more for me. [/h2]

Long time ago, like 7–8 years ago, I played The Witcher 3 for the first time on PS4. I already knew what The Witcher series is, knew what to expect. Remember spending more than a hundred hours in it, loving it. But I was a high schooler at the time, and think I just couldn't comprehend the whole beauty of this game and its world.

Now, so many years later, after getting inspired by [url=https://www.twitch.tv/elajjaz] Elajjaz [/url] streams of the first two Witcher games, I decided to re-play The Witcher 3 myself, and damn, what a good decision it was.

So, the last month and a half I was living and breathing Witcher, I was obsessed, I still am. I didn't expect to be so emotionally invested in it again, despite knowing/remembering story bits and such.

After so many years, the game still holds up gracefully. Yes, some aspects are clunky, like horse riding or fist fighting, there are occasional bugs, but everything else is just perfect. The game is beautiful, it sounds good, it feels good. With years, I started to appreciate art more, the amount of work people put into it, and how it affects us - gamers, readers, listeners. I wanted to literally bathe in The Witcher world and atmosphere.

Every aspect of this game is like a puzzle piece to me that fits perfectly with other pieces and completes the whole stunning picture. The visual design, models, locations, world building etc. are so good. Just walking through the streets of Novigrad or nature of Skellige Isles is an unforgettable experience. Soundtrack of this game is something else entirely - unique, varied, emotional, always accompanies your adventure, moments of peace, danger and sorrow. Every time I hear Priscilla's song and [url=https://youtu.be/8RIaIO9Fs64] cover of it in Ukrainian by Eileen [/url], I do my best not to shed a tear; every time I hear Kaer Morhen theme it feels like getting back home; every time I hear ""Yes, I Do..."" my heart trembles and I have a smile on my face.

And of course characters and their stories, that is what makes this game truly special. I love characters in The Witcher. They are so expressive, so interesting. You know that feeling when you just want to see your favorite characters and listen to their dialogs? Look at their interaction with each other and such? It's just incredible when you don't need action happening on screen, you don't need explicit scenes and such, you just want to sit there listening to stories of Ciri's adventures, play a round of Gwent with Zoltan, look in the eyes of your beloved Triss or Yen. Also, I really loved the English voice-acting, actors and actresses did an amazing job in bringing all the characters to life. In such moments, you understand how important well written characters are, because they are the ones that make us so emotionally attached to games like The Witcher. Did you see and/or remember that 10th anniversary of The Witcher series video with all the characters? Priceless.

I understand that my personal experience doesn't translate into everyone's else, we are all different, seek different things in games, perceive the world in our own way. I expect that, maybe, many people will disagree with me, but The Witcher 3 really is one of the greatest games of all time, I would recommend it to anyone without any hesitation. The sheer amount of emotions and feelings, amazing storytelling, characters, atmosphere this game has you won't find anywhere else. During such moments I am actually proud to be a human being, live alongside and witness all the art that other people create. And this game definitely is a work of art.

Thank you CDPR and all the developers and artists who worked on the game for such an experience that will stay in the heart of gamers forever.",True,Strategy

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I liked this game a lot more than expected. This was my first Witcher game. I will say the story was definitely a bit confusing at the beginning if that is the case. After a while though I understood most of what was happening and really loved the plot (the endings are meh in my opinion).

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is absolutely amazing. It was a bit hard to understand at first since it’s a bit different than the average open-world game, but once I make those slight changes, this game easily became one of, if not my favorite open-world game I’ve ever played. The amount of quests and other things you can do is already amazing in itself, but the fact that every single one of those quests is high quality and fun to do, and never gets repetitive is even better. Not to mention the sort of connection you feel with this world after playing for hours and hours. All in all, this game is spectacular, and if you’re even slightly interested and are thinking about giving this a try, do it. This game is definitely worth the $40, BUT it does go on sale for very low amounts, so I would recommend waiting for that price drop.",True,Strategy

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Finally completed this game 9 years after getting it. Quite pleasant to play with the current version of the game as it has lots of QoL features. 

I had kind of given up on playing Witcher 3 due to some tragic events with various gaming laptops all while playing Witcher 3.  No other game has busted anything before or after so it kind of felt that this game puts a curse on the PCs. However, after completing Cyberpunk 2077 I decided to give it a shot and finally finished it.",True,Strategy

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Quite simply put, in a world without Skyrim, this would be the best Action-RPG EVER MADE.  Due to, at the time, technical issues, bugs and glitches, etc this game was lowered significantly from where its standing should have been and it still BARELY loses to Skyrim.  In the years since, the bugs have been quashed and technical limitations have been lifted with the advent of new generations of graphics cards, but too little too late.  By then everyone who was going to play the game seriously had already played it.  For what its worth, I dropped probably 500 hours into the console version (PS5) of this game and an additional 80 something (starting a fresh run, going up) on computer because I love it that much.  If you like 3rd person sword play w/ light spell casting and a fun poison build up meter based on the ""witchers poisons"" you are using trying to not become a monster yourself.  Quests are VERY gray area and there is no right or wrong answer.  Sometimes you are going to do everything right and everyone is going to die.  That is just this games way of saying, ""what, you arent Rand Al'thor from 'The Wheel of Time' series (well the book series anyway) and you dont have near limitless power, you are Geralt of Rivia and crap doesnt always go your way and you cant control it.  I prefer it that way to be honest.  Gives it that human lived in feeling.  All in all 10/10.  Phenominal  once in a decade type of game.",True,Strategy

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"So, I first picked up the Witcher 3 back when it first released; I was a teenager at the time and didn’t quite click with the game, so it sat in my PS4 library collecting dust for nearly a decade.

In 2023 my fiancé and I had just bought a 4090 and built our very first PC together, and the Witcher 3 —plus all its DLC and next-gen updates!— was on sale for less than 8$, so I nabbed it then thinking I’d give it another shot.

Well, here we are almost 200 hours later lol. This game is fantastic and it gave me a sense of child-like wonder I haven’t had since BG3 and BoTW/ToTK. Everything that didn’t click with me as a child clicked with me now in a wonderful, compelling way.

Gameplay is fluid, exciting, and fun. Mixing and matching different mutations, skills, and equipment was rewarding; the story and characters were written superbly, only faltering in small pockets of my experience; the political aspect of the game was shockingly complex and a total blast to learn about and navigate in.

Also, it can’t be understated how genuinely breathtaking this game is at moments. The music composition and art direction created a completely unique identity for this game that left me entirely enraptured.

I would heavily recommend anyone still on the fence about this game (like I was) to give it another go if it didn’t click before. When it clicks it *clicks*.

It is easy to tell that this game was with great care and love. The DLCs are also amazing and provide almost just as much content as the main game.

I know eventually I will explore other titles and discover more beauty and immense creativity, but I don't think that will happen anytime in the near future. The Path beckons me.",True,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Personally, this probably is the best RPG. I've played a lot (cracked before tho, LOL) but this one is the best. I wish they can just expand the story of Geralt further for Witcher 4 rather than Ciri's. This is my opinion only.",True,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"One of the greatest RPGs ever made, and for good reason. The game offers an expansive open world, deep storytelling, and immersive gameplay that set a new standard for the genre.

Story & Characters
You step into the boots of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter navigating a world torn by war, political intrigue, and supernatural threats. The main story revolves around finding Ciri, Geralt’s adopted daughter, while avoiding the ominous Wild Hunt. However, what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its side quests—many of which feel as compelling as the main narrative. Choices matter, and the consequences are often unpredictable, leading to multiple possible endings.

The characters are equally memorable. From the fiery Yennefer to the charming yet tragic Triss, and the brooding yet lovable Dandelion, the cast is filled with depth. Even minor NPCs have well-written backstories, making the world feel alive.

Gameplay & Combat
Combat in The Witcher 3 is fluid, involving a mix of swordplay, magic (signs), and alchemy. While some may find the combat a bit clunky at first, mastering dodging, parrying, and potion usage makes encounters feel rewarding. Enemy variety is excellent, and the game encourages preparation—using the right oils, bombs, and tactics against different monsters.

Beyond combat, the game is filled with activities: exploring vast landscapes, playing Gwent (the in-game card game that became so popular it got a standalone version), crafting, and hunting monsters for contracts. The open world is one of the most detailed and immersive in gaming history, with stunning environments ranging from the war-torn lands of Velen to the bustling cities of Novigrad and the majestic Skellige Isles.

Graphics & Sound
Visually, The Witcher 3 remains stunning even years after release. The day-night cycle, weather effects, and character animations contribute to an incredibly immersive experience. The soundtrack is equally brilliant, featuring Slavic-inspired compositions that perfectly complement the game's dark fantasy setting.

Expansions
The DLCs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, are more than just add-ons—they are full-fledged expansions that offer some of the best content in the game. Blood and Wine even introduces an entirely new region, Toussaint, with its own storyline and improved mechanics.

Verdict
With a deeply engaging story, rich open-world exploration, and meaningful choices, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an RPG masterpiece. Whether you're a fan of narrative-driven games, action-packed combat, or simply exploring beautifully crafted worlds, this game is a must-play.

Monster Hunter: World,"Monster Hunter: World is a [b]very special game[/b] to me, it was my first experience with the Monster Hunter series and my introduction to the franchise. I first started playing back in 2018 on PS4 as part of the [b]new 5th Generation of Hunters[/b], completely new to the series.  

At its core, [b]this game isn’t special in the traditional sense[/b]—there’s [b]no deep story[/b], [b]no memorable NPC interactions[/b], and [b]no standout characters[/b]. But for me, it became a [b]second home[/b], a game filled with [b]countless memories and unforgettable experiences[/b]. It's easily one of the [b]best games I’ve ever had the opportunity to play[/b].  

This game is exactly what its name suggests—you [b]hunt monsters[/b], with an emphasis on the word [b]hunt[/b]. You [b]study their behaviors[/b], [b]trap them[/b], [b]exploit their weaknesses[/b], and [b]adapt to their strengths[/b] in order to take them down. You use [b]various weapons, tools, and strategies[/b] to hunt these massive, catastrophic creatures, and it’s an absolute blast, especially with friends.  

I still remember [b]being terrified of my first Anjanath[/b], running for my life, screaming and here I an about to [b]solo my first Fatalis[/b](a super boss) though I’m pretty sure I’ll fail. This game has a unique, indescribable charm to it. It constantly [b]pushes you to improve[/b], giving you that [i]butterflies-in-your-stomach[/i] feeling every time you hit a wall that seems impossible to overcome—until, suddenly, [b]everything clicks[/b].  

[h2] Base Game & Iceborne Expansion [/h2]  

The game is split into two parts:  
- [b]Monster Hunter: World (Base Game)[/b] – This was my [b]introduction[/b] to the series, and I already liked it.  
- [b]Iceborne (DLC Expansion)[/b] – This is where I [b]fell in love[/b] with the game.  

Iceborne [b]forced me to ""Git Gud""[/b]—Master Rank hunts are no joke, especially post-Iceborne content like [b]Tempered Furious Rajang[/b] and [b]Arch-Tempered Velkhana[/b]. No matter how much I improve, I still can’t beat them, but teaming up with random players and hacking away at these monsters is a ton of fun.  

The game is [b]easy to pick up but hard to master[/b]. The difficulty spikes can be [b]brutal and abrupt[/b], so take your time, be patient, and adapt you’re a hunter, and finding a way to take down the monster is part of the challenge.  

This game [b]isn’t for everyone[/b]—some might even hate it and never want to touch it again. But give it a shot—who knows? You might end up loving it just as much as I did.  

I loved this game so much that I bought it a second time on Steam, along with the Iceborne DLC when it went on sale. The DLC is locked behind the main game, so you need to reach a certain point before accessing it, but it’s 100% worth it. It actually [b]provides more content than the base game itself but only buy it after completing the base game.

[h2] ❌ Cons & Performance Issues [/h2]  

This game [b]isn’t perfect[/b], and there are some [b]performance issues[/b], but they can be improved:  

- The game has [b]too much unoptimized code[/b] that causes unnecessary performance drops. A simple fix is to install a mod called [b]""Performance Booster and Plugin Extender""[/b] from NexusMods. This mod significantly improves performance and is easy to install.  
> [i]Note: Mods in this game [b]do not disable achievements[/b], so [b]completionists[/b] can use them without worries.[/i]  

- [b]Turn off Volumetric Fog[/b] if you’re experiencing performance issues. 

[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]  

Monster Hunter: World is an awesome game. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it’s a hell of a lot of fun.  I’m planning to buy Monster Hunter: Wilds when it comes out, I played its open beta, and it was a blast.  
I might update this review if I manage to beat Fatalis, get 100% achievements, and finally [b]wrap up this game[/b].",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"This is more like my thoughts on this game as a first-timer in MH franchise than a complete breakdown review, but in a good way. (Tl;dr available)

There's no words that can explain how much i love this game. This was my first MH game i played and im absolutely loving it to the point im quite obsessed (i never expected to be THAT obsessed). Gotta thank the friends of mine who gave me enough encouragement to give it a try. My only regret is that i never bothered to try it earlier even when this game had collab with my favorite franchises on its earlier days.

If you're more into a Singleplayer game than a game that's designed for Multiplayer like me, i can assure you can enjoy this game as much as i do (i do solo more than multi most of the time). Just put a little bit effort to understand the game loop and mechanic if you're a first-timer. In result, you'll stuck in this hell forever (or should i say, heaven?). Interesting weapon tree, armor, skill mechanics, cool monster fight and design, less stress when you're struggling with a certain boss (too much to write the reasons why but you'll get it once you try it yourself), everything's detailed even a little silly stuff like emotes and cats, and alot of stuff to explore post-story (you have to purchase the expansion as well for this but i swear it's worth to get especially it gets discounted quite often). What could you have asked more? 

Sometimes, i wish i had the capability to erase all of the memory i had in this game so that i can experience this game for the first time again. 

Tl;dr, I love this game and would recommend it.

Monster Hunter: World,"With Wilds dropping in just a few hours i thought it would be a good time to write a short review on one of my favourite games of all time. This was the game that, like many of us, got me into the series as a whole and what made me fall in love with it. I was 17 when i first started playing Monster Hunter: World with my younger brother (who introduced me to it) and am now going into my mid 20's and cannot express how much this series means to me, going back and forth between older generations and newer generations has been a blast and i'm so excited to see what the series has in store next. 

If you haven't played any of the games yet, especially this one, i would highly recommend it. Grab a few friends and have a fun time and enjoy everything this game has to offer. You won't regret it :)",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Upon my second play though (my first being on PS4), I've realized just how much this game rewards proper preparation, but on your first play though things can get pretty tough. This is especially true when you don't know resource upkeep. The combat is top notch and promotes observation when you are playing solo and in groups it can feel more like a hack and slash on easy fights.  Iceborne is a more challenging experience where utility items are arguably less useful, and the armor skills are more important, but the fights are especially engaging regarding both at the end of the expansion. 

Customizing your armor set for your or your weapon's playstyle will go a long way. SO much personality in this game, despite the actual plot being boring (unless you like ecology, and bland dialogue). The consensus is melee weapons are more fun than the ranged ones (bow being the most fun of the ranged out of the 3 for melee players imo, vs. 11 melee weapons with varying speed, damage, and size)",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"[h1] The Good, the Grind, and the Great Jagras[/h1]
After what feels like centuries of grinding, I've finally unlocked the last achievement for Monster Hunter: World. This game is an RPG with so much personality, style, and detail that I can’t help but recommend it. However, there are some mechanics that could either draw you in or turn you away completely.

[olist]
[*]Story multiplayer – Each monster has a unique cutscene that must be viewed before you can play with a friend. That means if you want to play through the story, you’ll need to do this weird dance where you enter the mission, watch the cutscene, then invite your friend while trying not to get annihilated by the new monster attacking you. it's still worth it if you enjoy playing with friends, but it is tedious.

[*]Fight time – If you’re new to these types of games, be prepared to spend anywhere from 10 to 30+ minutes fighting some of these monsters, depending on your skill level. In late game as an experience player, you can get them down to 5-10 minutes but overall, these monsters are meant to be lengthy fights where they will run to survive and use the environment to their advantage. It makes the fights feel real, but I can see this frustrating some players, especially since there is a timer that is always running and cannot be paused. 

[*]The grind – There is so much customization in this game: interesting builds, mixing and matching armor and weapons. The more you play, the easier the game gets. It’s an RPG player's dream, but of course, you’ll need to work for it. Although there are good methods for farming, we all eventually will need to grind for that one material. If you’re just here for the story and a couple of optional fights, it’s really not that bad. But once you get to endgame, prepare yourself. One of the endgame locations, the Guiding Lands is literally nicknamed the Grinding Lands by the player base because it is that bad. If you want the absolute best gear, it will take a long time. I’ve beaten every monster in the game solo and still have not maxed out my main weapon.

[*]The weapon tree/forging and upgrade system – Every new player I see is confused and overwhelmed upon viewing this abomination of a UI. Basically, you forge weapons in one tree, then navigate to another UI, which looks the same, to upgrade them. I refuse to believe there isn’t a better way to do this. If you’ve played these games, it’s not an issue, but if your UI confuses the majority of new players every time, then there’s probably a better way. A minor issue, but we can do better.
[/olist]

At the end of the day, you either like this style of gameplay or you don’t—that’s it. But I think it deserves a chance at least. The excitement of seeing a new monster, somehow more powerful than the last, and defeating it to craft its unique gear is such a joy. Every fight feels rewarding, you’re always working towards something. Even after 200 hours, I discovered that you could climb the mountain in the ice map all the way to the top, where a rare celestial jellyfish can spawn for you to catch and display in your room. These small details accumulate to create special maps that are still interesting to explore years after release.

In short, does this game have issues and mechanics that some people won’t enjoy? Of course. But the detail, care, and passion put into this game are some of the best, and it deserves to be played. That feeling of overcoming an impossible obstacle is unmatched—from your first fight all the way to your last.",True,Strategy

Monster Hunter: World,"[h1][i]Monster Hunter: World[/i] (2018) is the fourth main game but believe it or not the 22nd game entry in the series and the first to come to Windows/PC.

This game is incredibly fun and challenging, however it is a completionists worst nightmare as there's never-ending side quests and you never feel like your catching up.

If it wasn't for the active player base responding to my SOS flares I never would have beaten it. Huge shout out to everyone that helped me!

[i]Iceborne[/i] is where I drew the line. It went from a fun challenge to down right Dark Souls difficulty. Too f*cking hard and not fun at all...

The loop of hunting and crafting better and cooler gear is almost intoxicating probably the only annoying thing about this game is the probability(the desire sensor is real).

Monster Hunter: World,"Seven years after the initial release, I'm still going back to this game. It's fun, it's stable, and there are hours upon hours of content to enjoy with the inclusion of Iceborne. Though this is not my first MonHun game (that goes to MonHun Tri for the Wii), it is undoubtedly my current favorite (sorry, Rise). Yes, it was buggy during the initial years and it only ever stabilized completely after Iceborne, but it was always fun. Even with the announcement and, at the time of writing this, the release of MonHun Wilds, I'm still grinding away at a new weapon with my best friend and helping him see the rest of the game, as he never played through the DLC. 

It's not a perfect game. The weapon designs are lacking a bit, and sometimes the monster models glitch out from time to time, but the game is stable and I've never had an issue with multiplayer. Definitely recommend this game for newer players who are interested in the franchise, but cannot get MH Wilds. 100% pick this up especially if the bundle with the DLC is on sale.

One thing that is really strange though, I've essentially played this as a single player game. For MH that seems peculiar. But out of all my hours, I'm pretty certain less than 5 were on multiplayer. 

Dialogue and plot are terrible.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Zero respect for your time. Unskippable cutscenes, multiple second long animations on every single action, ten second stun effects applied by the majority of all attacks and a ""hunting"" experience focused around hoping you bump into the small line of clues that will actually spawn the monster into the world. All this for the monster to decide to instantly run away to the opposite side of the map after no more than a minute of fighting. Not even the combat escapes from the slog - your weapon will become fully dull potentially dozens of times per fight, forcing everything to an abrupt halt while you sit in a corner smacking your sword until it works again every thirty seconds.

It's all the worst parts of Evolve and Dauntless mashed into a janky mess which explains very little and is rarely even correct in its own explanations - the claw attack meant to reposition a monster that you're climbing almost never does anything, as an example. And then it's all centered around a core gear upgrade mechanic that means very little, because all of your upgrades just make your numbers higher at a somewhat even pace with the natural increases in the enemies' numbers, as though it were some shitty half-baked MMO.

Genuinely the worst experience I've had with any game in its genre, ever. Catastrophically bad, utterly wasteful of every single second invested into it. Every single mission resulted in a net negative enjoyment value. Even when the fucking stars align and things start to get just a little engaging, you can ALWAYS be killed in one hit because attacks will sometimes apply the same instance of damage multiple times. It's pathetic.",False,Strategy

This has made me 1000x more excited about Wilds and i cant wait feeling like monster hunter could easily become one of my new favorite games. If it looks and feels this good from a game that was made in 2018-2019 i can only imagine how insane the new one is going to feel with it looking amazing already graphics wise.

Anyone who is planning on getting WIlds on the 28th i HIGHLY recommend playing World if you never have. Amazing experience and will get you well prepared to be a monster hunter!

Monster Hunter: World,"I really liked the base game back when it came out, it was one of my favorite experiences of that year and maybe that generation, unfortunately I was one of the people who almost completely soured on the game because of the DLC, I don't think it's unplayable or too hard, but the tenderizing mechanic which is almost obligatory for some hunts in iceborn, transforms what is an extremely rich combat system into something really formulaic and tedious.

Monster Hunter: World,"Monster Hunter: World – Honest Review

Pros:
	•	Combat is incredibly satisfying. The variety of weapons and the depth of their mechanics make each hunt feel fresh and engaging. Throwing monsters into walls and other high-impact moves give the battles a cinematic feel, making every encounter feel dynamic.
	•	The world is stunning. The environments are beautifully designed, with diverse biomes ranging from lush jungles to barren deserts. The scale and attention to detail in each area create an immersive world that feels alive.
	•	The story is solid and engaging. It’s much longer than in previous Monster Hunter games, and it does a great job of keeping you hooked with the progression of the main story and side quests. The latter are varied, rewarding, and add depth to the game.
	•	The turf wars between monsters are a highlight. Watching the massive creatures battle each other adds a level of unpredictability and excitement to the game.
	•	Armor and weapon designs are fantastic. There’s a wide variety of armor sets and weapons to grind for, with designs that look cool and make you feel powerful as you progress.
	•	Endgame content is solid. Once you finish the main story, the game opens up with a plethora of monsters to hunt, Elder Dragons, and other challenges to keep you engaged for hours.

Cons:
	•	The multiplayer experience can be frustrating. While World supports co-op play, the matchmaking system can be slow, and connectivity issues with other players often disrupt the experience. Additionally, multiplayer is not cross-progression, so you can’t share progress across different accounts or platforms. This means if you want to play with a friend, you’ll have to do quests on your own, then join their quest, and then repeat the process by completing their quests on your end. It’s a bit tedious and can make group play less enjoyable than it should be.
	•	NPCs like the Handler lack personality. While the world and monsters are fascinating, the NPCs—especially the Handler—feel flat and uninteresting. They often don’t add much to the experience and can make interactions feel tedious.
	•	Long load times are a hassle. Whether it’s traveling between zones or starting a hunt, loading times can drag, making the game feel slower than it should be, especially during longer grind sessions.
	•	The grind can get repetitive. While crafting new gear and hunting monsters is rewarding, the process can sometimes feel like a slog, especially when you’re chasing specific materials for gear upgrades.
	•	Pacing issues can be frustrating. Some hunts feel too easy, while others spike in difficulty without warning. This can lead to an uneven experience that may feel frustrating depending on the monster you’re hunting.
	•	Post-launch updates were hit or miss. The early post-launch updates felt sparse, and while Iceborne later added significant content, the base game’s post-launch support didn’t always live up to expectations.

Personal Note:
Having spent over 400 hours across both PC and Xbox, Monster Hunter: World is one of the most immersive and rewarding games I’ve played. The combat is top-notch, the world is beautiful, and hunting down massive monsters is always fun. While the grind can feel tedious at times, the rewards and satisfaction of slaying tough monsters keep me coming back for more.

Final Verdict:
Monster Hunter: World is a massive, thrilling game that brings the Monster Hunter series into the mainstream with engaging combat, an immersive world, and solid progression systems. Despite its flaws—like frustrating multiplayer, flat NPCs, long load times, and repetitive grinding—the core experience remains exceptional.

Score: 9.5/10 – A must-play for action RPG fans, with hours of content to keep you hooked.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Honestly, I'd say this is the peak of what Monster Hunter can be. Wilds should have improved upon this formula, but instead opted to hand the player absolutely everything and completely neuter any kind of challenge this game franchise had. 

Monster Hunter: World was my first foray into the series (followed by Rise, and then the old school games) and I can say that after playing through 2 decades worth of games, World is Monster Hunter at it's peak. The world looks amazing, the monsters are all unique (even the re-skins, because they get new mechanics/move-sets), and the weapons and armor sets are all immaculate. 

There's 40+ hours of base game content and then (from what I read) another almost 40 hours of content. I just came off a playthrough in Wilds that took me, no joke, 20 hours total and that was including SIDE content (70 dollar game, by the way). I honestly came back to World because of how abysmal Wilds is in it's current state just to remember what the MH dev team is actually capable of. 

If you're on the fence and you're here looking at World vs. Wilds, just do yourself a favor and get World. Sure, it's harder to get into, but there's so much to do once you have a handle on the basics of the game that you'll easily spend 300+ hours playing. I know I will until Wilds eventually comes around.",True,Strategy

Monster Hunter: World,"Good game, it's easy to pick up and difficult to master.  There is a ton of information up front but it makes sense after a while.  You basically go around in one of the levels which are beautiful little ecosystems, you find a monster (demon/dinosaur/dragon) you get in a fight with it, (Usually turns into a Family Guy chicken fight episode) you kill it, you take the materials you get from killing it and make better gear and go kill bigger/meaner/tougher monsters.  You can choose from a ton of armors and several weapons which all have a whole art behind them.  (Basically you cant just pick up a weapon and go, you have to get good with it)  Great graphics, great game loop, insane amount of hours you can put in, and the story was basically written by a anime loving 5 year old with a crayon.  9.5/10 I love this game.

First time picking it up was just sensory overload with terrible menu systems and an overload of poorly explained game systems.  Combat felt weird and clunky as well.

I decided to come back a few weeks later and I'm so glad I did!  Once I was able to get into the gameplay and loop I was able to see how great this title is and why people love it so much!  If you want to get into MH this is a great start since Wilds is still so poorly optimized.

Take the game slow.  Know that you will be overwhelmed with systems and how to play the game.  Don't sweat it, just take it all in and enjoy the hunt.  Hope more people can find the magic in this game as well!",True,Strategy

It's immersive, it makes you feel like you're a part of the environment. The QoL changes do make a massive difference when compared to the older titles.

I rate this game a solid 10. It deserves it. Whether you're someone new who wants to get into the franchise or an old time player who wants to see what this installment holds in the MH franchise, I highly implore you to give this game a shot. You won't regret it.",True,Strategy

Monster Hunter: World,"I played the base game on Xbox One when it released and decided to buy it again with the Iceborne expansion on Steam after buying a PC.

To start, it's not exactly an easy game to get into for anyone that hasn't played a Monster Hunter game before. It takes patience and a good deal of learning. There are 14 weapons to choose from and each one have their own specific mechanics. The weapons are like a game within a game. Armors have ""skills"" that can enhance specific mechanics. The base game alone have countless monsters and it's necessary for the player to learn most of them to get enjoyment out of this title. After hunting a monster, you get parts to craft new weapons and armor. Tools and gadgets are also a very necessary aspect of hunting, though most of them are fairly straight forward and the more complex ones have tutorials.

That being said, the payoff is immense for those willing to put in the time and effort to learn the game. There's nothing like a perfectly timed execution of a very strong attack you've been building up to that results in toppling a monster capable of one tapping you.

The only people i would advise caution for is if you either A) Dont like repeating an activity several times to work towards a reward or B) do not like buildcrafting / loadout planning in games, as those are both core aspects of this series.

[hr]
Being the first game in the Franchise to release for the big consoles and PC, World was leaps and bounds ahead of any previous entry in nearly every aspect. Graphically it can still be considered the best in the series, even with the recent release of Wilds,

Monster Tracking was streamlined with the new Scoutflies, which in this iteration strike a great middle ground between tracking the monster and learning about its habits and locations, while eliminating the tedium of re-applying paintballs every few minutes.

Exploration in general saw a massive boon with the removal of loading zones, allowing the maps to not only look like a cohesive area, but paired with the increased interactivity between the different Flora and Fauna it really did a great job making the World feel alive.

Buildcrafting saw an upgrade with the reworking of the old Armor Perk System to a more intuitive system of 1 Point = 1 Level, as well as Palicos getting new support gear tied to your exploration of the varied ecosystems.


I could go on, but there really isnt anything particularly negative to say about World. Unlike some of the newer generations, it doesnt have any one gimmick or quirk to rely on, it just took the Monster Hunter formula and showered it in love and care to push it as far as they could, and then some with Iceborne.

Gameplay is totally unique and immensely satisfying, there’s nothing that plays quite like it. Moves are weighty and punchy and fun. The gameplay loop is addictive. Good stuff.

I’m onto Wilds now on my PS5 while my fiancé picks up his first Monster Hunter game ever on PC, so I thought I’d write this review as a (most likely temporary) send-off to a game that has kept me good company for the last 7 years or so.

Monster Hunter: World,"long story, cool moments, for peeps who like to grind, cool cut scenes and bosses, although some things are a tad bit.... annoying to deal with, its over all a great experience you can play with friends or with others. you cant skip cut scenes the first time around though.... including the credits.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,It is just the best gameplay out there bar none.,True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Monster Hunter: World seems like your typical hunting simulator like every other mobile game right? Wrong. Monster Hunter: World is a free-world exploring game where, as the name suggests, you're hunting monsters, from small raptor like creatures, to titanic monsters the size of Godzilla.
The story, lore, and designs of the creatures are amazing, and give it a realistic feel to it. I highly recommend you check it out.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"After over 1000 hours on the Playstation, here are a few more hours of play until Wilds is released: This one has brought Monster Hunter to perfection. Insane support over many years, lots of content, from easy to difficult. Quality of life changes compared to the parts before. Weapons with many moves that were even expanded with Iceborn. A pretty good and exciting story for Monster Hunter, although I didn't really care about it before, this one really grabbed me and entertained me well. A still very active player base (which may change with the release of Wilds), good monster designs, good selection of old familiar monsters. An absolutely stunningly beautiful world, it looks great, is superbly built in all three dimensions and full of secrets and corners that are always worth exploring. It's the perfect Monster Hunter game, 10/10 points. The only drawback is the rather high barrier to entry for new players, but in my opinion this is common to the entire franchise.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Game is very fun. If you enjoy a game play loop of craft basic gear > fight enemy > gather crafting mats > build better gear > fight stronger enemy > rinse and repeat, then you'll enjoy this game. Fun and manageable solo, but even more fun in co-op. Vast amount of weapons and armor to choose from, all with different skills to match your own play style. Its honestly one of those games that you can play even well after you finish the main story. There's always stuff to do and hunt.  Would Highly recommend picking the game up and playing through it.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Monster Hunter: World is a towering achievement that redefines what an action RPG can be, blending jaw-dropping spectacle with intricate gameplay that keeps you hooked for hundreds of hours. Capcom crafted a living, breathing ecosystem where every hunt—whether against a towering Rathalos or a cunning Anjanath—feels like an epic showdown. The combat is precise and rewarding, demanding mastery of your chosen weapon while offering endless build variety through crafting and upgrades. The world itself is a visual marvel, teeming with detail, and the seamless co-op makes slaying behemoths with friends an absolute thrill. Even the grind feels purposeful, turning every rare drop into a victory dance.

I’m giving Monster Hunter: World a perfect 10 out of 10. It’s a generational must-play—a game that sets the bar for immersion, challenge, and sheer fun. Whether you’re a solo hunter or a squad leader, this is one title you can’t miss. Buy it, play it, live it.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,its good. in other words its possibly the single best games in existence. at least iceborn is. but you gotta get through this to get to the good stuff.  like a potato. but yes. starts off easy yet grindy and then theres hard mode which just gets better. harder monsters and better fights. and right after that. iceborn. first of all sick name but second off all so many hard fights. this part of the game is just harder with each hunt and really makes you try. and then the ultra later game. holy crap bro. raging brachy and Furiouse rajang where tough but then i got to alatreon and now the other two are easy. then dont get me started on fatalis. its possibly the only game that gets better throughout the whole thing. cant really fit all i could say but as a long time player of the series i can approve this game as the best yet. besides MH4U but thats probably bias to be fair. and MH3U. anywho good game 10/10 do recommend. also ive got i think like 400+ hours between my brother playstation and my PC. mostly on the playstation tho,True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Been playing since Generations and at first, this kind of game is not for me, mainly because of the weapon weight/delay, so didn't play it. after rise came out on the SWITCH, i realized that, maybe just maybe i can put up with it..it did.. so i opened up generations, played it, bought Ultimate, MH stories, played that..and im just hooked on the series. then i bought World because its on sale and i just sold my feet pic for the extra income and the game just push my love for this series to a whole new level.. can't express how much i recommend playing this game, everyone new to the series, please, try and play the game. it might be frustrating at first but when you defeat your first few monsters, the adrenaline for more challenges and improving your gear is just crazy!",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,I have too many hours on this game. Love it so much that I've played it on multiple platforms.,True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"This is my first Monster Hunter game and I've fallen in love with it! I really like the mechanics of tracking a monster, getting to discover different worlds with completely different resources and monsters, ... and of course battling the monsters! Thanks to 14 different weapon types (which can each be upgraded to do either elemental damage or status effects, or just more base damage), you can tailor the play style to your liking.

Word of warning: Don't choose the defender armor as a newcomer, it's made to get you to the add-on content as fast as possible and you'll basically play the game on easy mode if you don't intentionally want to rush ahead. I only found this information on reddit when I was wondering what armor to pick and I think it should be pointed out by the game (can't go wrong with either leather or chainmail). Otherwise fantastic.",True,Strategy
Monster Hunter: World,"Hammer go bonk. Greatsword hits hard. What more can I say?

Incredible amounts of content for a base game, not to mention the DLC Iceborne adding nearly an entire new games worth of content. 

Poured countless hours into this game, not including here on steam. Played well over 500+ hours between Steam and Xbox One. Absolutely worth giving it an honest shot, and seeing what it is about. Just be patient, try the weapons, and go wild.",True,Strategy

Monster Hunter: World,"The progression and world building are very satisfying,

That said, this is some of the most frustrating and least fun combat I've played.  The absurdly slow windups, along with hard to aim thin swings, are paired with no ability to cancel and some of the worst iframes on rolls.  I do not feel like I'm getting good at this game, nor would I care to. Instead I'm just going to keep grinding armor to outlast the slugfest.  It really is too bad this game is so obsessed with pretty animations and chained combos.  They will simply never be useful.

Monster Hunter: World,"Bought it when it was on sale. It was my first official introduction to the Monster Hunter franchise ever since I borrowed my classmate's PSP (PlaystationPortable) and played Monster Hunter Unite years ago. I was playing in his account just slaying dragons. MH World was the next-gen of Monster Hunter for consoles and PC. I'm glad I played it first before proceeding to buy Monster Hunter Wilds. It's not just slaying monster, it also has a story that would keep you playing, and also a DLC (Iceborne) that is as huge as the main game. Not to mention the postgame/endgame content for those who want more even after finishing both the story of the World and Iceborne. That would explain my 106 hours of playtime, I believe. Would definitely recommend to those who are new to the franchise like me, trying different weapons and crafting a diverse set of armors. It's more fun with friends and with the game allowing you to even team-up even strangers and ask for assistance from other hunters. Would totally recommend to others.",True,Strategy

Monster Hunter: World,"This game... is absolutely gorgeous. I've actually used screenshots of it as wallpapers on my computer. The gameplay is fun, even better with friends. I've put almost 500 hours into this game so far and feel like I could easily double it grinding for the things I want, even cosmetic items. It's easy to get lost in ""one more hunt"" or ""let me just gather these resources""... making money in the game is easy, and you definitely get paid fairly for things you sell. There's even items that are purely meant to sell to help you earn so you can upgrade weapons. Speaking of weapons, there are so many to choose from that play into many different play styles. Everything from duel swords with fast paced close-range fighting to bow and arrow which allow a more ranged agile version, to a giant hammer for strong perfectly timed hard hitting damage. The initial story line can sometimes be difficult to play multiplayer, as the cutscenes must be watched before others can join, however it definitely gets better in the Iceborn DLC. There's always something you can be doing to help progress, gather items, or level up. Or just run around on an expedition and fight everything you see. The choice is yours.

DARK SOULS™ III,"[h2] My Favorite Boss-Rush Game [/h2]

If you are familiar with From Software's souls games, you may know Sekiro has best boss battles this series has to offer (Idk If you even consider Sekiro a souls game.). Why am I talking about Sekiro right now? You see, Sekiro was my first souls game and after playing it, other games like Elden Ring, Demon Souls and Dark Souls Remastered, I felt like something was missing from these games. Dark Souls 3 made me realize it was the unforgetable boss battles what I have been looking for. Of course I am not saying ER or DS don't have any good bosses but Dark Souls 3 is another level If we are talking about boss fights. We will come to this topic later but first, let's dive into other details.

[h3] Gameplay and Combat [/h3]

Since there are hundres of souls games I assume you have played at least one of them. If you didn't, don't worry because combat is so simple. You have light/heavy attacks and you can use dodge roll to avoid attacks. That basically sums it up. Although it may sound simple, you will be addicted to it. There tons of fun builds you can mess around with, timing your attacks and roll times, finding enemies' weak spots etc. These are what makes it addictive. All weapons in the game has unique skills but unfortunately, execution is not as idea sounds. There is high chance that you will find yourself using weapons because you liked the weapon, not its skill. Eventually you will stop using weapon arts. I am glad FS actually fixed this problem in Elden Ring. Combat is faster than previous Dark Souls games. If you have played any Soulsborne game after Dark Souls 2 you will get used to it quickly.

[h3] Level Design and Boss Fights [/h3]

It is a known fact that in terms of level design, Dark Souls 3 is very inferior to first game. While I agree with this, I don't have any problems with linear levels. Nothing comes to my mind when I think about a single bad designed level in DS3. Levels may not be connected to each other which kills the immersion of world. However, after playing hours and hours, it becomes to tiring to explore areas and do backtracking in first game. Dark Souls 3 is more comfortable in that regard.

As I said earlier boss fights are where this game shines. Most of fights aren't perfect, especially during early game. I almost quit this game because I found them so easy and boring (I am not flexing by the way.). Actually I can't remember a single boss that took more than 15 minutes to beat. But in later parts, fights became more engaging. Still easy, yes but yet so fun. Especially in DLCs, I don't want to spoil anything.

[h3] Should you get this game? [/h3]
Answer is yes BUT wait for sale. 60$ is too much for this game. If you are okay with money, don't wait a single sec. One of the best action-rpg on market.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"It seems that I'm addicted to die. It can be from a boss, a dog or gravity, you never know. But I can't stop playing it... 
Also the soundtrack is just a masterpiece.

DARK SOULS™ III,"Beautiful game. most definitely in my personal top 5 games of all time. very fun, challenging and awarding and overall top notch",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"The game is great for an end to the trilogy. When comparing the level design to their past games, the levels were not as good. The bosses made up for the level design though. Good quality bosses especially the final boss. Its even better if you have played Dark Souls 1. Overall really great game and the bosses in the ringed city dlc were super good quality as well.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"Yes, indeed. It is called College. Where the transitory lands of the exhausted students converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words. The GPA fades, and the homework goes unsolved. When the link of graduation is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old lords of success from their graves. Wikipedia, saint of knowledge. Caffeine's sleepless legion, the one-nighters. And the reclusive lord of the drunk capital, Alcohol, the giant. Only in truth, the lords will barely do good, and the unhealthy will rise. Nameless accursed students, unfit even to be a functional part of society. And so it is that the student seeketh jobs.

DARK SOULS™ III,"Dark Souls 3 was my first FromSoftware game and my introduction to the soulslike genre. Of course it was hard at first and I quit after getting lost at High Wall of Lothric and not being able to beat Vordt. After 3 years I managed to play Elden Ring and after beating half of the base game I came back to Dark Souls 3 to give it another try. I had a much better time with the game and after beating it, it became my favorite game ever. Since then I've finished Elden Ring and its DLC, I've beaten Dark Souls Remastered and I am now playing Dark Souls 2. Now I can say that I love all of these games and I recommend them with all my heart. The story telling, the world building, the lore, the gameplay, the music, the voice acting, I love everything about them and even if they seem to be the same game with different names, if you actually play them you will see that they are very different from each other, each offering a completely unique experience.

DARK SOULS™ III,"Even though I still have a relatively low playtime compared to some people, this is probably my favorite game of all time. This takes everything I love about the souls-like formula and basically perfects it.

I know a lot of people find this too linear or too easy compared to FromSoftware's other games, but it is MY favorite.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"I really enjoyed how the upgrade system works - constant desire to upgrade my character and main weapon gives a big wave of motivation to continue playing. However, I expected this game to have more bosses; originally I thought that most of the time I will be practising fighting them, but, to my regret,this game is more about exploring the map, and CONSTANTLY killing annoying mobs that you've killed already multiple times. Overall, this game gets really annoying sometimes: I even abandoned it for a long period of time, but then returned and successfully finished it. I'll give it a solid 7/10.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"Peak. Besides the poison swamp. Easily the most fun boss fights in the series, but the world isn't nearly as charming as DS1.
Had to disable e-cores in order to get it to stop hitching.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"One of the best of the entire FromSoftware franchise. It is far less forgiving than Elden Ring, so if you're new, be prepared to have a miserable time until you've reached sharingan levels of reaction speeds. either that, or face tank your way through it, that's fine too.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"Honestly, one of the greatest games I've played. It's a wonderful story, with brutal, but rewarding combat.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,didnt expect it to be easier than elden ring or maybe im more used to elden ring. i love the fact u can do anything but jump in place. 10/10 game,True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"Overall good game. Got it day one on console and got the soundtrack on disc as a preorder bonus. Great game. Mechanically, it might be the best Souls game.

Unfortunately, the amount of one shots and stun locks in the game keep it from being a better game than it could be. They really emphasized more ""punishment"" in the game than they did difficulty. A lot of fans get those two terms confused for the same thing and apparently the developers did as well. Not really a hard game, but one screw up can delete your entire health bar even when it's more than halfway across your screen. 

Input Reading is still stupid and enemies should have a more normal reaction to your character healing or attacking. Seeing the enemy dodge away at the exact same time I press the attack button is dumb. Seeing the enemy start an attack at the same time I press heal is also dumb. This makes the game feel more like a guessing game. ""What inputs am I allowed in this fight?"". This limits the player to only being allowed to use heal or R1/RB(Basic attack) when the enemy is already in the middle of another animation.

Arbitrary rules like ""This merchant disappears from Firelink Shrine if you progress past this point and you can no longer access their shop until the next playthrough"" is still in. Another aspect I don't like about these games. This was old since the original Dark Souls but it's still in the game.

Best part: A lot of these issues are still in the most recent release(Elden Ring) but on the bright side, This game has probably the fewest amount of delayed attacks and it actually feels good. Not too many, but just enough. From Software doesn't seem to fix a lot from their games per title, it's more like after four sequels, you have all the fixes you should've had in one but it's better than nothing and at least you no longer are required to clawgrip the controller the play the game optimally in the upcoming game. It only took 16 years but I guess it's better than never.

DARK SOULS™ III,"This was my third FromSoftware game after Elden Ring and Sekiro. Compared to my previous experience, the game offered a refreshing look at the classic of the Souls series. Of course, there are some outdated mechanics and the lack of a normal jump makes you get used to the game again. However, after a few hours of playing, the atmosphere and music completely immerse you in the gameplay and you forget about all the minor flaws. The design of the bosses, game levels and the world as a whole is at the top level. Of course, compared to Elden Ring and Sekiro, the bosses are much weaker and almost all the bosses in the game were quite easy to defeat. After 50 hours, I was able to complete the entire main game and both DLC and NG+ for all achievements.

DARK SOULS™ III,"Dark Souls 3 is the best title combat wise, but lacks when it comes to unique areas. Almost every area has been done before in Dark Souls 1, 2 or Bloodborne, but is more refined in this game. The World is very linear compared to the other titles, which has the benefit of getting a steadily increasing challenge, without difficulty spikes or lows. On the other hand, the aspect of planning a route to play through the game, based on prior knowledge and build, is completely absent from this title, making replays very samey and without variety.

The Gameplay is Dark Souls, faster than DS1 or DS2 but slower than Bloodborne. There are lots of weapons and Spells to choose from, Rings to get a variety of buffs and Armor that has almost no use besides looking good. 

DS3's Story takes place after countless rekindelings of the first flame, Kingdoms have come and gone over countless centuries and still the flame keeps dying. You play as unkindled ash, once cast away by the flame, unfit to rekindle now reawoken to rescue it.

DARK SOULS™ III,"A great game, definitely worth playing, but You should keep in mind that it differs a lot from the DS 1 or DS 2.

Lets start with cons:
1. Technical issues:
    - Game doesn't support 21:9 screens (You will get black stripes on the sides of the screen).
    - All control hints are for controllers - they're not adapted to the keyboard/mouse.
    - Mouse sensitivity is way too high even on the lowest preset.
2. In contrast to DS 1 and DS 2, throughout the most of the game, You won't get that experience when You don't know where to go or if You did choose a right path - just because there's only one path (with slight deviations and optional detours a few times).
3. Also noticed that I ended the game with all the starting equipment (sword, armor, shield). I didn't feel the urge to replace them with any other piece of equipment. That's a little bit off-putting.
4. For me personally the first 5-7 hours of the game were really disappointing, and the linear locations didn't help that at all.

That's all. Everything else is just great. 
- Controls are comfortable (except mouse sensitivity).
- Enemies are interesting (except for the first 5-7 hours) to deal with.
- Bosses are indeed engaging + there's no repetitiveness, which we had in DS 2.
- Setting, locations and sound design, graphics quality, all that is fantastic.
- Everything else, which I did forgot to mention is great too.",True,Strategy

DARK SOULS™ III,"A lot of the fights were very enjoyable but damn this game is hard. Also there are some very annoying things like not being given the slightest indication as to where to go, because the areas are very complex to navigate. Bonfire locations are also weird as some of them are literally right next to each other, but then you won't find another for another 30 minutes which makes it frustrating.

The item system doesn't make a ton of sense either, with armor being an almost entirely negligible factor. Last gripe is with the handmaiden which sells items and those are limited stock for the entire game, so if you need more embers for a boss fight and you've already purchased all of them then you're fucked and you need to go farm embers yourself which is annoying.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ III,"I greatly enjoyed Dark Souls 3, but it was not the masterpiece I was expecting. 

For background, I haven't played any other Dark Souls games. I have played some Souls-likes, particularly Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. I 100%'d Sekiro and it's currently one of my all-time favorite games. I came into this experience expecting a challenging, fair gauntlet of brutally difficult and interesting combat. That is mostly what I did experience. I play on mouse and keyboard for all of my games, so that is the experience I describe here. In short: I would not consider Dark Souls 3 to be on the same level as Sekiro, although it is still a very good game overall, with my main issues being with the consistency of the experience. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10. 

To go more into detail, let’s draw some comparisons to Sekiro. First, DS3 is an RPG where you design and build a character as you play. Sekiro has an eponymous protagonist you play AS, rather than a PC of your own. This means that while you can learn different combat styles and play your own way to some extent, there is not the same level of customization and open-endedness of style that DS3 offers. I actually think this serves to Sekiro's strength. DS3 is a demanding game and forces the player into one of several playstyles rather early on. If you are not following a guide or planning your build from the beginning without changing it, you will suffer. Not knowing what to expect, I started out doing a balanced STR/DEX build with sword and shield. After about six hours of play, I was so frustrated at my inability to defeat enemies that I completely changed my build and went all-in on STR with a massive greatsword. This was really fun and got me through the midgame with very few issues, and forced me to learn a new combat style in order to succeed. I appreciate the game for this, but my poor early decision-making meant that at higher levels, my points in DEX, VIG, and VIT were useless. Not wanting to grind out more levels for hours, I had to face the final bosses with imperfect stats and gear. It took much longer than usual for me to beat the endgame bosses for this reason. By contrast, Sekiro's more streamlined combat style means that no player is ever harshly punished for the style in which they choose to play. 

The camera sucks. It's total garbage, it ruined dozens of fights for me. If I could change one thing about this game it would be that. Let’s move on. 

One thing that gamers often laud about the DS series is how punishing its combat is. I found there is certainly a learning curve in the early game, and lategame bosses are highly difficult unless you have an  optimized build; however, for the midgame bosses, the predictability of their movesets and how well-telegraphed they are actually made the fights trivial for me. I have a list at the bottom of how many tries each boss took me; some of them I beat in one try. In Sekiro, I consistently struggled against every boss before beating it, having to spend a great deal of time learning their movesets and timings before striking. This consistency of struggle meant that I was rewarded for my time and diligence in a consistent way; whereas in DS3 my feeling was much more of a series of difficulty spikes, bounded more by frustration than by feeling rewarded. 

DS3 is often touted as tough but fair. I would not characterize it as such, at all. Tough, sometimes. Fair, sometimes. Both, sometimes, but just as often not. There is very little consistency about when the environment is destructible and when it is not, first of all. Some enemies and bosses will eviscerate large stone pillars by brushing against them, but those same pillars are immutable when hit with my greatsword for 500 damage. Another gripe: sometimes enemies can be hit through the environment, such that you can hit or be hit by an attack that somehow phases through part of a wall or a staircase. To be clear, I like that this is exploitable in a game that often feels unfair against me; it means I can make the game unfair in my favor for a moment instead. The point here is that it's an issue with the fairness overall that I think the devs were shooting for. 

Finally, collision detection. IMO this is not a small problem with the game, but the main one. In a fighting game which is ostensibly all about timing attacks and dodges and knowing exactly where your opponent is going to be at all times so you can hit them just right, I ran into dozens of situations over my playthrough where the collision detection was blatantly unfair, and never once was it unfair in my favor. For example: say you have a spear or lance, and you go to stab it at an enemy that is between you and your spearpoint. Your attack will miss, and rightfully so. However, take that same example and reverse the player and enemy, and suddenly their attack will hit you. I ran into numerous other issues where my attacks went through an enemy instead of hitting them. An illustrative example of this is during the fight with the King of the Storm, there are a couple attack patterns where his dragon's head can’t be hit even though it's right in front of you and you're swinging a greatsword directly through it. This is just bad game design.

Some positives: I really enjoyed the strange lore of this game, to the extent that I went out of my way to read wiki articles between runs. Also, the difficulty in learning how to play is not nearly as much as I thought it would be; perhaps that is helped by the fact that I've already 100%'d Sekiro. I liked nearly everything about the combat system, including the audio and visual feedback on strikes and kills, and the satisfaction of one-shotting enemies in mid to lategame was great. I really enjoyed the variety of enemies faced, the variety of environments to explore, and how even though the game is primarily one-track, like Sekiro, there are many alternate paths you can take. There were a few environments I greatly disliked, due to huge spikes in difficulty or frustration; namely, the swamp areas which force you to walk slowly, and the Smouldering Lake, whose enemies are much quicker than any ones you faced previously. I disliked annoying mechanics like the giant firing lances at you from a tower, only to agree to stop immediately once you talk to him for two seconds. I enjoyed the silly one-off mechanics like dipping your head in wax to avoid curse damage from spooky bookshelves. I found most of the environment designs beautiful, deeply immersive, and well-thought out. Once you get into the gameplay pattern of each new area, it becomes intuitive, and you stop worrying about what's next and start enjoying the ride. 

At its best, Dark Souls 3 was immensely fun and satisfying. But other times, sheer frustration with the game's innate mechanical systems, quirks, or intentional design choices made it a chore to keep playing. When I finished Sekiro for the first time, I immediately hit New Game + and played again, excited to experience that combat all over again from the beginning. When I finished Dark Souls 3, I felt relieved that I wouldn't have to keep playing this game anymore, but pleased with myself for finishing. I think the absolute bane of this game is its lack of consistency--of difficulty, of expectations of the player, of enjoyment, even of the rules of combat. This, in comparison to Sekiro, is my main problem with the game and why I won't be playing it again for a long time.

DARK SOULS™ III,"Dark Souls 3 is, without a doubt, one of the greatest entries in the legendary Souls series and a perfect culmination of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s vision. From the tight, satisfying combat to the hauntingly beautiful world design, this game encapsulates everything that makes the Dark Souls franchise unforgettable. The level of depth and detail in every corner of the world is unmatched, with each area offering unique challenges and a rich, dark lore to uncover.

The combat is fluid and precise, with a variety of playstyles and weapon choices that ensure every player can find their preferred way to fight. Parrying, dodging, and strategic attacks come together in a system that rewards skill and timing. The difficulty, while unforgiving, always feels fair — every death serves as a learning experience, pushing you to improve and become stronger with each attempt.

Boss battles in Dark Souls 3 are truly a work of art. These monumental encounters not only test your reflexes and strategy but also carry with them an emotional weight. Each boss feels like a unique challenge, with beautifully designed movesets and lore that ties into the world. The standout feature, however, is the music — the boss themes are absolutely breathtaking, often sending chills down your spine as you face these towering adversaries. The music isn’t just background noise; it’s a key part of the experience, amplifying the intensity and emotion of each battle.

The world of Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece, filled with intricate lore and environments that feel alive and connected. From the desolate landscapes to the fiery depths, every location is a work of art, with hidden paths, traps, and secrets that reward exploration. Miyazaki’s signature touch is evident in the way the world feels connected, with areas that loop back into one another, creating a sense of cohesion and immersion.

The atmosphere is further enriched by a haunting soundtrack, with tracks that perfectly complement the bleak yet beautiful world. The game’s story, though subtle and open to interpretation, pulls you deeper into its world, keeping you hooked until the very end.

For fans of challenging action RPGs, Dark Souls 3 is a must-play. It’s an unforgettable journey that pushes you to your limits, but the sense of accomplishment that comes with overcoming its challenges is unparalleled. This game is a true masterpiece and a perfect testament to the genius of Hidetaka Miyazaki and the FromSoftware team. 10/10 — an absolute triumph of game design.",True,Strategy

As far as level design and world design go - some criticize Dark Souls III for being too derivative of the first game in terms of general style and vibe, and that's often completely warranted. Apart from Irithyll, it really feels like a decent variation on Lordran, and offers very little we haven't already seen before. That's not to say it's [i]bad[/i], it's just familiar, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. There's definitely no ""Lost Izalith/Demon Ruins"" moment and thank god for that. One thing I do feel is a downgrade from the first Dark Souls' tightly interwoven world design and Dark Souls II's messy, but extensive world, is the linearity of the whole experience. The satisfying shortcuts and loopbacks are still present (albeit [i]within[/i] an area, rather than between them), and fast travel is once again available since the start. However, it's a much more straight line with the occasional detour than Dark Souls I or II. Like the familiar art direction, it's a matter of preference.

Before I start the all-out praise-singing, I just briefly wanted to touch on the story and lore. Unlike Dark Souls, which is unique for perhaps no other reason than being the first to do so, or Dark Souls II, which veered into different tropes and told its own rich tale, Dark Souls III kind of feels like a re-telling of the first game, and I found myself caring a lot less for the story and lore than the other two games.

Alright then - where this game absolutely knocks it out of the park, and then out of the continent, the atmosphere and into outer space, is the gameplay and above all, the bosses. The build variety is up there with all the FromSoft games, and if you're dogged enough, anything is viable. But - we all know what we're here for, the sweet, sweet ""learn the attack pattern, git gud and prevail"" high, and Dark Souls III delivers this in spades. I loved Elden Ring and I played it before playing this for the first time, but I often felt Elden Ring's combat, especially in the latter half, took a turn for the ridiculous in a way that I really didn't appreciate. Here, there's none of that. No overbearing particle effects or endless combos, no ""oh you can dodge it bro just dodge left right up down diagonal back 71 times"" AoE wipe attacks, when you die, you rarely feel like the game just decided to overwhelm you. The controls are the best they've ever been, the bosses are a clean, tight affair full of finesse and interesting attack patterns - if you fail, the reason is you done goofed 99.9% of the time. There truly are so many memorable encounters like the Nameless King, Sister Friede, Slave Knight Gael, Darkeater Midir, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, I could go on and on. There's the odd gimmick fight and a few rather forgettable bosses (I don't remember the Crystal Sage or Cursed Tree bosses at all, they just felt kind of... there), but the selection on offer is nothing short of stellar. The fights are faster and a little more emphasis is put on rolling, but I was extremely happy with the bosses and I will definitely be coming back for more.

In conclusion, having now finished all three Dark Souls games, I can confidently say that while the original Dark Souls will always be my favourite for purely subjective reasons, and while Dark Souls II is a great game in its own right despite its admittedly numerous flaws, Dark Souls III is definitely the best and most refined of the three in many, many aspects. If you liked the first two games and/or Elden Ring, you'll feel right at home here. Grab your favourite bonking implement, spammy slashy-pokey dex instrument, pew-pew staff or chime and prepare to have the YOU DIED screen burnt into your eyes. It's a great time.",True,Strategy

Europa Universalis IV,"I played EU4 much closer to release and logged most of my 300+ hours then. Really enjoyed it. Understood it. Loved it. If I reviewed it then it would have been a positive review. But I am reviewing it now after trying to pick it up again after a couple year break and will be submitting this review based on my recent experience which was... not great.

So I reinstalled EU4 thinking with over 300 hours in the game I should be able to pick it up relatively easy. Nope. Spent an hour and change clicking around different menus before quitting in confusion. It's a dense game, okay. Spent an hour and a half on the wiki, looking up general information, trying to familiarize myself with EU4 again. Next day, better idea of what's going on, I log in and spend half an hour looking through different menus before again quitting in confusion. Lot has changed since the last time I played.

Okay, I watch the first part of a a let's play starter guide for Brandenburg. I played them before, did a partial world conquest years ago, I have been staring at their menus for almost 2 hours at this point, it should be easy to follow. And it is! I write down everything the streamer does thinking I will analyze what all the options mean and try to piece out why those were good decisions. I go into the game, start following the list, and one of the estate options I am supposed to do is not in my game. Apparently it's specific to the domination DLC. $20 bucks. Hmm. Oh well, keep calm and carry on. I can probably still follow this guide and get a feel for the game. Hm. One of the diplomatic options the streamer uses, 'curry favor' is not in my game. Apparently that's specific to the leviathan DLC. $20 bucks. Wait - I think my mission tree options look different than his mission tree options. Yes, locked behind specific DLCs, there, too. And that's my breaking point. Quit out. Uninstall.  Decide to write this review to vent my frustration.

I am betting EU4 is still a fantastic game for those that have been consistently playing and keeping up with the DLC as they come out, learning little by little what's changed. If you are looking to play EU4 now after a long break, though, just don't. If you are looking to get into EU4 for the first time, just don't. At the same time it's somehow become both bloated and chopped up through DLCs. So unless you want to get the EU4 subscription service - which I think is an awful model for the video game industry to adopt - the game just isn't playable. Such a frustrating shame.",False,Strategy

Europa Universalis IV,"Europa Universalis IV – The Ultimate “Suffer Now, Enjoy Later” Simulator
Before I got into Europa Universalis IV, I bought it, got overwhelmed, and refunded it. Three times. Then, I bought it again. This time, I had a friend hold my hand through the brutal learning curve, because let’s be honest—this game does not care if you understand how it works.

Years later, I tried to return to it after a long break. Big mistake. I booted it up, looked at all the menus, and immediately realized: I had no idea what I was doing. Again. It’s the kind of game where if you don’t play for a while, you basically have to relearn everything from scratch. Nothing about EU4 is intuitive. The UI? Cluttered. The mechanics? Complicated. The tutorials? Might as well be written in Latin.

And yet… I still recommend it.

Because despite the suffering, despite the hours of not having fun while just learning how to play, I put 363+ hours into it. Clearly, I saw something in it that kept me coming back. Once you break through the barrier of confusion, EU4 becomes an incredibly deep and rewarding experience.

-Lots of killers from classic horror films.
-Lots of perks and an enjoyable game when people play fair.

1) Matchmaking is horrible.

>End game collapse occurs (you are a killer) and survivor (last one) does not die when the timer hits zero keeping you locked in the game endlessly unless you exit the game and get penalized (you are held hostage).

>Survivors do not die once hooked for the 3rd time and fall off the hook (basically an immortal survivor).  

3) Developers don't seem to care about people being able to cheat.

4) Long hours needed to grind to unlock survivors, killers, and perks.

5) Play and know that no matter how good you are, you will be  matched with poorly skilled players.

If you play solo, queue killer - although it becomes repetitive and boring and doesn't really have much charm to it/loses its charm very very quickly. the chances of winning solo queue survivor is not likely at all. there a LOT of things they could do to balance the game but it will never happen.

The gameplay devs are clearly the most deadweight people at Behavior.

There's also lots of cosmetic options in simple categories and the season pass has interesting rewards even in the free path.

Unfortunately then you have whoever's in charge of actually designing the gameplay elements, who I assume is led by a liberal arts major dropout. They intentionally keep things poorly balanced, keeping some killers just indefinitely weak, perks weak, different maps lopsided to favor survivors or killers, the experience as a frustration simulator, make nonsensical nerfs, have almost no transparency, no protection against hackers, exploitable mechanics, no plans to retroactively improve older killers or their Mori (execution moves), challenges that actively encourage throwing matches, predatory in-game micro-transactions where sales cost more than just buying chapters on steam, a janky leveling system that's as frustrating as the gameplay, slow progression, a mobile version that was an improvement over the standard version you can buy here but they'll never implement any of the liked features from that, and the sad part is that it's in its currently best state in years according to veteran players.

Buy it if you don't mind suffering for something that is, at its core, a really fun concept. I keep playing it despite how frustrating it is. I keep spending money on it despite the developers not fixing anything until it becomes their problem.

Dead by Daylight,"I really enjoyed playing this game, but...
The devs constantly kill the fun in the game. Survivors can still give up on the hook. ""Burden"" is a perk for some reason, not a game mechanic. So you have to use it in your games, like all the anti-tunnel perks, to not tilt for obvious reasons. So you can't play with other perks because there are only 4 perk slots. So there is no argument that they are adding all this to the game to fix this. No. You have to sacrifice your fun in perks to have quality of life in the game. The devs look at the numbers and don't really listen to the people who are actually playing their game. So they think solo queue is okay. But in reality it is a PAIN. This is why people stop playing your game. Because there is almost nothing you can fix to make it balanced and FUN. Who cares what new perks you bring if all that matters is gens (the main goal of the game) and chases. You need to design your game around BUILDS. So it will be fun to theory craft in the game. But you can't really think about builds because your game designer doesn't play the game! And if players find interesting and fun builds - you nerf them! That's why you kill the fun!
For example: I found a build with dh-saboteur-mom-breakout. It was so fun to run under the hook and not get hit by the killer, and then you had 0.5 seconds to break the hook and use dh. Then I made a guide on your forum, and a month or two later you nerfed the animations, and then dh, so it became impossible! And that's just one example!

Death threats, racism, sexism, pretty much every kind of hateful bull that one game could have in it. At the end of the day, your better to spend your money on a good quality game that doesnt run off of bugs and glitches.

Dead by Daylight,"One of my most played games so i kind of wanted to review it. Many who play it says it's got a very toxic fanbase etc.. But after playing League SO MUCH lately this game pales in comparision imao and getting back into this game after feels like a nice warm vacation.
It's definitely hard to get into when you are new but you'll get the hang of it just like with most games. I say this but at 500 hours i still royally suck and sort of run around like a headless chicken.  But still the mechanics are very simple though and for every time you play you learn more, get more map awareness and it just becomes muscle memory at some point and you sort of learn to do some stuff automatic.  If you have played Texas Chainsaw Massacre then this game is so much more simple to get into.
The tricky part is that there are a lot of perks/items to remember and recognice 

And again about the community. I feel like MOST are actually pretty understandable if you are new but just remember camping/slugging is very frowned upon so if you are new try to avoid doing this. It's basically being a bad sport.  I did this a lot starting out and i got so confused by the angry end game messages which usually were in russian (:",True,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,Some of the best and worst moments of my gaming life. Would not recommend unless you want to go through all the stages of grief.,False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"I've played this game on and off since it's release, through various iterations and updates.

I am mostly a survivor main.  I occasionally play killer.

I would not recommend this game to new players for numerous reasons, chief amongst them would be the sheer amount of work it would take to 'catch up' and the knowledge that comes along with every single perk (killer and survivor) in the game.  I would say that people don't even really begin to understand DbD until they reach about 300 hours in the game (Not I said understand; not master).  

On the survivor side; you have to deal with killers of various play styles. You've got some that are honorable and will not chase people off hooks, tunnel, slug, ect al.  You've got people who will chase the first thing that moves in front of them (I call these T-rex killers, affectionately of course).  And you've got the new meta of killers who will slug all 4 survivors and leave you to lay on the ground for 4-5 minutes until you bleed out and die.    Aside from being new and learning how to play the game, you will have to deal with the aforementioned killers (The last one is probably the worst and most common killer you will find these days) while practicing; which can be extremely aggravating and probably make you quit the game before you invest any serious amount of time into the game.

Survivors and killers(Except for the licensed ones) can be obtained through LONG gameplay.  (A typical killer will run you anywhere from 4,500 - 9,000 iridescent shards). I don't know the numerics for new accounts; but once your account reaches level 50, you will gain 300 shards per level increase.  You'll need about 4,200 exp to level up your account each time beyond 50.  You'll get around 600 exp per game; so ideally you'll gain a level every 7 matches.  9000 shards / 300 per level = 30 levels for each new character you want to unlock.    In a perfect world you're looking at 42 hours of gameplay for each unlock.... or you could just spend $5-10 to unlock a chapter granting you the killer and survivor. 

That's the first part.  You want their perks?  Well now you need to level up either one and prestige them 3 times to grant their three perks to the rest of your survivor/killers as maximum level perks.  (Each perk has 3 levels, each granting more stats than the last). 

Now we move on to cosmetics.  You see a really cute outfit on a character you like playing?  That'll run you anywhere from 500-24,000 iridescent shards depending on it's rarity.  Of course, this can be negated by paying real money. 

They do have seasonal battle passes (both normal and paid) that give cosmetic rewards and if you end up playing enough, I would say the $10 premium rewards are well worth it.",False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"the game used to be really fun but playing as a survivor has turned into a pretty painful experience. all the perks that gave survivors a chance have been nerfed. too many killers immediately start tunneling, camping and slugging at the beginning of the game while also having many perks for auras and regressing gens that help them with that. I get doing those things during the endgame but not with 3-5 gens left. they should put some soft of system in there that prevents them from doing that. it's also horrible how most teammates never even touch a gen or unhook anyone in time. all of the issues have become worse and worse in the past few months. not to mention my ping being good, the killers ping being bad and it messing with the chase lol",False,Strategy

I would rather deal with the ridiculous wait times, than the current state of this community tbh.

Dead by Daylight,"I would love to recommend this game if it wasn't for it's current state. I started playing back in 2021 before taking a three year break for issues they never fixed. 

The game is terrible for new players, with the release of FNAF coming this summer (2025) it will surely bring in new players. But with the games health, all these players will not touch it again. 90% of perks are locked behind paywalls on both killer and survivor after already paying £15 for this game at base rate, most killers have special powers and abilities which is hard for new players to pick up in order to learn how to counter, each side (survivor or killer) is hard to grasp with many people outplaying you simply due to a larger experience as there isn't ~really~ an mmr system. I go against a range from very good killers/survivors to ones with minimal experience. Solo queue as a survivor is outrageously bad, I can't even fathom words for it. I wish there was a comp and casual game mode.

The game is terribly buggy with some bugs having remained in the game for YEARS (nurse bug im looking at you) or bugs in general take a long time to fix (if at all). Progression in the game takes hundreds of hours of grinding in order to P100 someone unless there is the once a year event which you can get loads of bloodpoints. 

Licenses keep this game alive because of their individual fanbases, not the fanbase of the actual game.

Dead by Daylight,"Don't be fooled into thinking this game is super awesome from all those nifty Youtube and Instagram shorts. It's been a rough road for many years.

This game HAD potential, and could have been a very great game, except that it was ruined by two things: 1) the most incompetent, unintelligent developers I've ever seen across the entire video game industry; and 2) the most toxic player community I've ever experienced.

I don't know if the developers have a faulty god complex or a severe, chronic case of OCD, etal. but they operate the game and control the community like a dictatorship. Granted, they're based in Canada, so they may be accustomed to that sort of stuff, but that doesn't resonate with people around the rest of the globe. These extremists have a grandiose vision of how you are supposed to act when you play their game and will micromanage every trend, every action, and punish the community over every little discrepancy that they deem ""wrong"". And apparently they get a kick out of punishing people, and are proud of themselves for it, because there's no indication that they're letting up. You can't say anything in the chatboxes, either. Why do the words ""die"", ""kill"", and ""hook"" get censored in a game about hooking and killing? Oh, and they pander to the gays and no one else. Go figure.

Furthermore, I have become more and more convinced over time that they have absolutely no knowledge of computer science. Each patch fixes ten bugs and causes twenty new ones. Most of the time, fixing one thing breaks another thing that is comparatively, completely unrelated. Why? How? Is your coding seriously that bad? It's the 21st Century. Video game companies should not still be fumbling around like they just discovered electricity. Come on, people (dictators*).

The overall neglect of recurring problems is the final of these three strikes against them. The community keeps telling them what needs fixing and they keep ignoring it. Do they even play their own game, or just throw out some half-@$$ patches every few months, hoping it calms the waters? Cheaters abound (despite the advertised anti-cheat system - news flash, guys {dictators*} - it apparently doesn't work, so you might want to do something about that), periodic issues with collision ruin games, and even their newest baby the 2v8 system has never-before-seen glitches. And what do the developers do? ""We are excited to announce a new string of cosmetics for your favorite characters to wear!"" Is this a 1v4 survival game or Barbie Dress-up? Cosmetics aren't good ""added content"" or ""rewards"" for crossing milestones (or paying sweet, sweet cash). We're bombarded with new outfits every month. If the developers would put as much effort into fixing their busted game as they do making new clothes that 0.5% of the community will ever use, they might actually craft a great game. If you guys want to design clothes and play dress-up, drop the video game career and open a fashion business. The best thing that could happen to this game is if its rights were sold to a different company. Hell, I'd prefer seeing Bethesda and Ubisoft collaborate than have the current team running the show.


And yet Behaviour is only half of the total problem. The other half is the pathetically awful player base they've attracted (created?). Now, I've never played Call of Duty, but I might even bet money that Dead by Daylight's community is worse than the stereotypical COD lobbies. Just look at the argumentative culture online amongst the players if you don't believe me. There is a huge rift among the players over every tiny issue, no matter what. It goes well beyond 'survivor mains v.s. killer mains'. That's only the tip of the iceberg. I could change 25% of one perk in the game and the community would explode. I could reconfigure the least-popular map and the community would explode.

People try to say that survivors are the most toxic players, but in my experience that's not true. It's only plausible/applicable to say that when you're facing a group of communicative friends playing together. Yet most of the time, you face four individuals when playing killer.
Playing against killers, on the other hand, drives you insane. Every killer plays the exact same way nowadays. They play almost as if they're robots, with no thought in their minds except ""I've got to get this 4-kill"". Very, very few killers have a personality at all anymore. They only care about getting you on the hook and moving on to the next person to do the same. Many of them can't even pick you up off the ground fast enough. It's like they've got money on the line. It's like a switch flips in their brains when they load in as killer, and they become almost, ALMOST inhuman. It's insane and I don't know how to fix it.

Somehow this game has attracted the scummiest gamers on the planet, but don't worry - the developers are about to release new cosmetics for your favorite character!

Dead by Daylight,"Frustrating, Unbalanced, and Full of Issues

I've been playing Dead by Daylight for a while now, and I have to say—it’s one of the most frustrating multiplayer experiences out there. The game had potential, but it's been bogged down by poor balancing, a toxic community, and constant technical issues.

1. Horrible Balance Issues
The game is notorious for either favoring killers or survivors, depending on the latest patch. Survivors have overwhelming second-chance perks, making it nearly impossible to secure kills, while killers can sometimes be overpowered, leaving survivors with no real chance of escape. Instead of true balance, the game just swings wildly between patches, frustrating both sides.

2. Terrible Matchmaking & Ranking System
The matchmaking is a complete joke. New players often get matched against experienced killers or teams of survivors running meta perks, making the game incredibly unfun. On top of that, the ranking system doesn't reward actual skill—it's all about grinding.

3. Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs
For a game that's been out since 2016, Dead by Daylight still feels like an early-access title. Hitboxes are wildly inconsistent, killers swing through objects, and survivors teleport due to lag. Dedicated servers are unreliable, and random disconnections happen way too often.

4. The Grind is Exhausting
Unlocking perks, characters, and cosmetics is painfully slow unless you’re willing to shell out money. The progression system is designed to make players frustrated enough to spend on DLC and in-game currency. It’s more of a cash grab than a rewarding experience.

5. Toxic Community & Unfair Mechanics
The community is one of the worst in online gaming. Both survivors and killers constantly BM (bad-manner), teabag, or spam emotes. It feels like a never-ending loop of toxic behavior, whether you're winning or losing. If you’re a killer, expect to get flashlight spammed and mocked at the exit gate. If you're a survivor, expect face-camping and tunneling.

Final Verdict
Dead by Daylight is a frustrating, unbalanced mess that relies too much on its existing fanbase rather than fixing core gameplay issues. If you enjoy being annoyed by unfair matchmaking, game-breaking bugs, and a toxic community, then by all means, give it a try. Otherwise, save yourself the headache and play something else.

Dead by Daylight,"The game is VERY unbalanced. When DBD first came out, they released mid killers because they expected players to play in the ""hide and seek"" style. But over time, the maps became more diverse, the killers became better and more capable, and the survivors began to master the art of ""looping"" which is actively encouraged by the developers, ignoring the original idea of ​​""hide and seek"". This led to a terrible imbalance because it is IMPOSSIBLE to use the killers that came out with the release, since they are completely unsuited to the current gameplay. Therefore, without donating in this game, you will lose the money spent on the game, keyboard, mouse, monitor and the desire to live, because the developers, instead of listening to the community and buffing the killers who OBVIOUSLY need a buff (killers that were released with the release of the game), nerf the killers who were fine anyway and add anime skins to their store.

Dead by Daylight,"Tbh i dont recommend you play this game. first played it back in 2018 on console the game is a far cry from what it used to be back then yea it was pretty unbalanced but it was still also pretty fun even on killer now. feels like you need god level skill to play the game as a survivor main my opinion may be a little bias but it feels like killers just get to have all the fun now while survivors are stuck in limbo for 5 dollars you can get a killer that does everything take liche for example the dnd collab kill that mf has 5 different abilities flying,blocking pallets,launching skeletons that take a health state and a bubble that exsposes where you are dont like that how about a killer that have two different teleports or you could always run the meta perks that just makes it painful to play the while survivors get nerfed to oblivion any perk step that helps you extend a chase for more than 15 second after getting hit nerf perks that make you speed up gen progression nerf maps to big making it hard for kills who move like there on crack to stop you from doing gens shorten it this game isnt built for solo play cause apparently every one plays the game with friends god forbid you try to solo q your just gonna end up with one guy in a locker half the time cause the killer has got a full perk step up thats just insta downs  or you get a guy tunneling one person as if his life depended on it or some teammates just scared to play the game if you thought 2018 was bad current patches takes it to the next level every one running the same 4 to 5 killer the same map back to back loops being butchered so the killer can have a ""fun time too"" the game isn't fun it a competition to see who can sweat the most in a game that has the worst ranking system know to man reach the highest rank for what just to get the same lobbies where if you run the killer to much or pallet stun him to many times you get camped on hook or finish the gens everyone about get out just for one guy to go down and now you have to leave cause that one kill is so important that just guard the hook the only reason this game still has a player base is cause there hang on to a hope that the game will actually get better that the devs will get there head out there asses and fix it instead of trying to get you too spend money on the latest collab skin which is the other thing keeping this game on life support if it wasn't for those this game would be dead like ow it needs competition to light a fire under the devs so they can realize that they need to make actual changes and not just throw everything to one side and say fuck the other cause with how it stands your better off just being a killer main cause it probably more enjoyable when you can have multiple game changing perks from from 1 to 2 of the new killers cause on survivor perks are mediocre at best and for a perk to get much value you need team coordination of the the highest quality all in all 2/10 don't play survivor unless you have some kind of fetish for suffering but hey the next collab skin got me dying in style",False,Strategy
Dead by Daylight,"Dead by Daylight is extremely fun almost addicting at times. albeit most people will claim that the game is survivor sided or killer sided are either inexperienced or have not researched into the perks and abilities to understand what ""balancing"" both killers and players actually entails. by no means is the game perfect with the evident shrinkage of maps and the removal of pallets in areas that was used frequently for survivors to escape from the killer. However, survivors and killers are supposed to have unique perks that are used to benefit each side, both come with pros and cons like every other multiplayer game. Players of the game need to understand that a game evolves overtime and no game is perfect regardless of how addicted we are to it.

Killers has unnecessarily stop/OP perks or Abilities that give them Some sort of speed increase or become undetectable On a short cool down, Even having the ability to down you from full HP to being on the floor in one hit. 
The game even gives them Walls with perks that allow them to see auras for far too long on Downing, hooking or killing some one and To add to all the Constant grief/trolling by your own teammates or the killer, Killers who refuse to hook you as the last one alive so the game wont end so you either wait or leave and get penalized with a wait time to que again.
Teammates who body block you, run the killer to you, refuse to help with gens, unhook people and so forth

Week(s) later; Figured maybe I was too new to the game and needed some more time to start to ""Enjoy"" it but no, The game is just awful; their in-game report system is probably the worst I've seen, unless you are recording every single match you play don't bother reporting anyone you play with as if you don't video or photo proof nothing happens.
They also have an event going on for a 2v8 that is not well liked to the point they have to add bots to every single game to fill it out as well as Up the BP you get from each match by 400%(as of right now) to Entice players to Que for it and still people are Queing as bots are in every lobby, Que times as a killer are 10 minutes plus+

a. They would rather ban players from all their social networks that criticize them instead of being transparent. 

3.  No accountability for their incompetence.

a.  Several instances of players providing them proof of hackers or their accounts being hacked and banned while the developers ignore them.  They refuse to investigate to reverse these unwarranted bans unless a big content creator makes a uproar about it, leaving those with no social media influence out of luck.

b. They treat the killer role as second class players (Civ 5 incident 2018 for one example).  If killer role finds a new strategy to use, they will quickly nerf it into the ground before nerfing anything for survivors.  They pander to survivors to appease them leaving their overpowered strategies to linger for much longer periods of time.  

C.  Pettiness of BHVR, removing twitch shirts of content creator for criticism, banning players for criticism, removing fog whisperer for speaking the truth.

You read that right, I dislike this game. It has taken my time, soul, and mental well being; threw it into the trash compactor; gives you a pat on the head then proceeds to chokeslam you into submission. 

The skill wall is immense for the average layman. There are a lot of secret details to think about as you go into each game. There's a bajillion different characters and a bajillion amount of data you need to keep up with if you want to keep yourself alive through the ages.

And oh I mean the word ""ages"" literally. If i were to start off as an infant playing this game, I'd be long 6ft under by the time you even get to finishing a game. Simply put, it's an oven set to slow burn. You not only pay $60 but you also pay with your time and soul if you play this game; and that's if assuming you bought at marketprice.

And that's just the vanilla version! The version that the least amount of people play in as apparently the game must be played with the DLCs to get a full experience out of it! You want to learn Civ via internet videos, well most dont care about vanilla civ. You came to play the game as you want to play as your country? Too bad, they're behind a huge paywall. Wanna play what was advertised as a game for the people? Well tough luck getting people trying to play this game with you!

And oh! That's not to mention multiplayer! You want to play with other people as a beginner and try to get the real experience of playing with others? Well tough luck as by the 10th turn the game's likely over and your going to play a game for 3 hours-or-more playing catch up. There is no skill based matchmaking, you just pick your options, start a match and hope people want to play with basic boring vanilla settings with a dude who is mid to absolute garbage at the game.

There's a lot of things I can say about this game. But having said all of that, I do have fun playing this game

It challenges you as a person to see how much you can put up overtime throughout the ages. It grants you the fun of THINKING and it provides you with rich historical lessons, quotes, and references. It provides you a method of developing skills, sharpening your mental capacities and teaching you strategy and logistics. It cultivates your patience as an individual, testing you as you test others as well. And most of all, it gives you the opportunity to say ""I Am Here!"" as should you play this game you come to terms of the reality that time is valuable and should be spent well, ironic as it is.

There's a lot of things agreeable and disagreeable to what I have written and I have come to terms with these. The Civ experience is different to many people. Whether playing solo or with your friends, whether you're having a good or bad time with this game, just remember to have fun.

The core tenants of Civ were always explore, build your empire, and either science the hell out of it or wage war like a college kid attacking a pizza after bar time.

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"
Excellent Civ game. Maybe the most complex game in the series if you want to play this to the utmost potential. I don't have Vietnam/Khan pack and haven't played Gathering Storm but I do own it and look forward to. Will update my review. This game has big differences from the previous Civs in the graphics/Style. I personally didn't care for it at but its grown on me. I don't remember Civ5 maybe because i didn't like it but loved 4. This game has everything I want in a ""One more turn its 2am Please Lord I need sleep"" experience.

 The combat is still my least favorite as its one hex per unit, i like the unit variation better but its not a huge + overall.  The game has emphasized expansion like crazy, I liked building Tall(less cities but more developed) but that strategy/playstyle doesn't work as well, Wonders which were my 2nd favorite thing about Civ games are definitely not as vital/important, just build more cities and the new districts system. Placement of buildings is a huge part of your game choices now, build it in spot X for + bonus  vs Spot Y for 0 bonuses. Diplomacy seems better, Science still fun part as is Religion which is a favorite way to play, Culture ties the whole whole convert the world theme together. Tons of different Civs to choose from so lots of replaybility.

With Civ 7 out Civ 6 is very affordable, i bought it for a fraction of what its worth on sale which is good because there is TONS of DLC content. Do yourself a favor and buy this during the fall and play till spring time. Its like winter didn't even happen.

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"An alchemist would have a field day with this game and it's DLC. Everything is equivalent exchange, for everything of value and necessity added there is a feature that only detracts. For every innovation there is a step backward. I can't imagine how 7 is worse but they pulled it off.

Pros- I could geek for hours about how cities work in this game. Its pretty much the only reason I come back from 5 (almost 2k hours) from time to time.

Cons- To summarize them all in a single point; the abandonment of diegesis in favor of arcady feeling and repetitive gameplay loops. Ages and the world congress involving the entire map at any given moment in time even before all civs have been discovered drives me insane AND EVERY FUCKING CIV CLONE IS DOING THIS THESE DAYS.

Generally most civ maps have 2 distinct clusters of nations that before deep sea travel only have access to nations within their region. This makes it so that by the time deep sea travel is possible there is something akin to a new world to be found with a geopolitical narrative unique to its continental situation and the civilizations that lived there. Maybe this game your continent is the one a few techs behind and you guys get discovered, maybe next save it's vice versa. Maybe there's a growing superpower that annexed all their early competitors just waiting to be found. Or decaying empires with overextended cities ripe for the taking.

The new age and world congress throws this out the window. It divides the game into unnatural feeling eras that force your nation to pace itself with civs it can't even see purely for the sake of getting enough good boy points to get the gold button, and not the black button. The world congress is just absurdly silly in the 5th millenium BCE, the idea that these policies could even be enforced this far back beyond just the fact that these nations are directly interacting and voting on things like the morality of resources.

The world congress in 5 is far from perfect, but instead of any attempt at reform they just doubled down on the problematic features and even got rid of abstaining (Why?Why?WHY?).

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"It feels like a streamlined Civ 5. I found it to be more intuitive to pick up than Civ 5 and I spent less time looking things up on the wiki or youtube guide. 

Playing Civ is a rewarding experience on many levels. I find the immersion in history and the roleplaying potential to be enriching while I focused on what I wanted to get out of each playthrough. I found that the scenarios I ran into while playing the game were a way to think about how I approach things in my life. Why did I struggle with not being aggressive enough in this playthrough? Why did I get crowded and found it difficult to settle? Why did I want this type of victory? What kind of world do I want to create with my Civilization, not just how do I want to win? It feels like there are endless scenarios that can happen in this game which gives me a reason to keep coming back after having played Civ 5 for 100 hours. 

I find Civ 6 easier to pick up and create scenarios in the game. It doesn't feel like there's something complicated in my way while I'm focused on how the game plays out.

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"There are obviously a lot of good things about this game, and I really would like to enjoy it. But a few elements have made it frustrating enough that I really don’t have fun playing it. 

(1) The biggest frustration is that the AI seems to very often declare war on me en masse for no particular reason. Including close trading partners, or civilizations on the other side of the map who have no military access to me and gain nothing by doing so. It feels like I have to play the game assuming that any civilization might attack me at any time, even if it is to their detriment to do so. It’s immersion breaking and needlessly limits the available ways of playing the game. 

(2) The messages from world leaders are repetitive and needlessly snide/temperamental/strange, while often not providing actual information. At least you can turn off the animations.  

(3) The barbarian tribes feel like a slog that I have to get through before I can actually start playing the game. You can turn them off, but I would rather they have been implemented differently.

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"I think that this is my favorite 4x game ever. Space 4x games are boring, because you are just looking at a bunch of white dots that represent stars the whole time while you're playing. Endless Legend was very good, because each race had its own style of play. Each civilization in Civ 6 is only slightly different. You should activate the Civilization Expanded mod from the Steam Workshop for Civ 6, because it gives more bonuses to each civilization. You can look up that mod on the internet to find a Excel spreadsheet that shows all the changes. There's also another mod on the Steam Workshop that gives each civilization an extra military unit, I can't remember what it's called. For America the unit is an Apache helicopter.

One day they will come out with a Civ game that starts in the 17th century when guns were first used in warfare, because that is when war first became fun. In Civ 6, you can start in the Renaissance Era using the game settings, but I couldn't really get it to work. It was a long time ago whenI tried it, but I think that my cities didn't have access to nearby resources so it was impossible to do anything. Of course, Firaxis developing a new Civ game that starts in the year 1600 with only a single settler wouldn't be realistic, and it is very important that games should always be realistic. That's why in Civ 7 you start as Benjamin Franklin ruling the Romans. Things need to make sense or nothing is fun. I wouldn't mind if the new CIv game only had six civilizations in it, but they all played differently. America could have a Star Wars laser missile defense system, because I know that America has it and the military is just hiding it from us.

The only way that I found that I could enjoy Civ 6 was going for a science victory. You can't really play tall with only a few cities, because you will need to have strategic resources like oil within your territory or you won't be able to defend yourself. And warfare in the game is fun, but it's not so much fun that I ever wanted to take over every city on the map for a domination victory. I never wanted to try for a religious victory, because monks fighting each other really isn't interesting. And you actually need to build up a religion that you don't need to win a culture victory, because for some reason religion is needed for rock bands. I have no idea why. But a science play through is fun if you build a bunch of campuses in all of your cities and attack your neighbors whenever you need something.

You should know that I never nuked anyone in the game, because that's mean.

I didn't buy Civ 7, because it looks altogether ridiculous from a game play standpoint. Apparently, you lose all of your units, cities, and resources every time an era changes. That seems to be the exact opposite of fun. I would suggest that you buy this game instead of that one, even though this one is $60! Are they serious?! The game has been out for nearly ten years! What is wrong with the world?!

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"Okay, important elements of the game: like interacting with leaders from different eras, technological progress without limits, and manipulating culture and religion in a short amount of time. In Civilization 6, the author demonstrates abilities that real rulers can only dream of, such as building a nuclear missile, discovering quantum physics, and changing the system from autocracy to democracy. They also mention the construction of the Pyramids and the Eiffel Tower, trading sheep to Egypt, creating a religion called ""Memology,"" and declaring war and apologizing after 10 minutes. These actions demonstrate their ability to create a utopian society. In the game of Civ6, leaders have the ability to instantaneously alter the government without facing any consequences, a capability that is of significant consequence. In a real-world context, such a power would undoubtedly lead to chaos. The game incorporates magical elements, with notable figures such as admirals and generals, as well as a loyalty system that can overturn cities due to cultural pressures. Spies are capable of instant missions, such as the theft of technology after a few turns. Punishments for warmongers are temporary, and trade can be used to acquire gold. Furthermore, the option for infinite re-election is available. The rush of projects financed by cash is another appealing aspect. Civilization 6 is a realistic game network that offers a unique perspective on politics and social issues. While in Civilisation 6 they face challenges including hacking neighbor's wifi passwords, starting revolutions through loyalty, declaring wars for resources, and attaining immortality through endless reelection, in comparison to real life players can easily navigate through dictatorship, communism, and corporatocracy. In Civilisation, the guru of hype and power is praised, but in reality, boosting pensions is a decade-long argument that has been cancelled out. Overall, Civilisation 6 provides a distinct take on politics and social concerns.",True,Strategy

It's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. I can feel the unique culture from within Night City, the different groups/gangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of Cyberpunk.

Now, the story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the Phantom Liberty expansion, LEVELS. The characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side Keanu Reeves? Not to mention Idris Elba.

Really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunning/hacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours.

Character customisation is just a delight and I enjoyed creating my different people.

I also really love the different routes you can take: Nomad, Streetkid, Corpo, which offers different dialogues and can have an impact your play style if you really want to enjoy the role playing part to the fullest.

Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 can be described the same way as Night City itself: glamorous and rotten to the core.

The city is detailed and gorgeous, but it's empty, acting only as a set dressing for missions. The missions themselves have strong moments, but the writing is sometimes atrocious. There are a lot of choices, but most of the time the world just does its thing (seriously, the game kept throwing Panam's crotch into my face no matter how much I tried to keep our relationship professional). There are interesting upgrades in the skill tree and cool weapons and tools to use, but after a short while, you become so powerful it doesn't matter what you use. Updates have fixed the worst technical issues, so now it's only as buggy as you would expect from other open world games.

There are more issues but I'm too lazy to write them down. I hope you get the idea. I was about to click the thumb down.

Then I went through the ""point of no return"" and after that took some time to think back on the journey.

I'll be honest. I really enjoyed the payoff. And looking back, I very much appreciate the attempt to improve on the burning pile that are open world games. Time will tell how I'll remember this game.

Cyberpunk 2077,"Bought it first time way back when it launched, it ran crappily even at potato graphics so I refunded. Fast forward to the game's patch 2.21, bought on sale. I can now play the game without frustration. I wish the draw distance and lighting in vanilla was better (though these can somewhat be adjusted to liking via mods).

Fun large map lots of things to do. Find your own fun delving into different styles of combat. 
Are you the cool stealthy ninja? Or are you Rambo? Or perhaps a sniper? or mayber a glance at people and fry their cybernetics as a netrunner? Or go cyberpsycho?

Plenty of mods abound as well if you want to spice things up. 

Storywise - No spoilers here, writing makes sense, character development shown. Nothing forced. Pacing could be better but it does not feel rushed nor sluggish. Wish there were some follow-ups to see the consequences of some choices ala Witcher 3. Wish there were some other choices available when it logistically makes sense as well.

Voice acting is amazing and brings the characters to life. Keanu is breathtaking as well.

I don't know if that's even fixable, but it's the only part of the game that now still looks janky. It runs great, it looks great, it plays great, the story's great, the sandbox and worldbuilding is fantastic, the variety is there, and the DLC gives you something that feels like a separate game entirely while still being distinctly Cyberpunk. You owe it to yourself to play it.

Cyberpunk 2077,"One of the best gaming experiences I've ever lived. Night City consumes you, it makes you care for its people, its past and future, and your place in it. Keanu Reeves is embodying one of the best roles in his career, engaging with him is super fun. The rest of the cast stand their ground too, esp the protagonist/s and the DLC characters are believable to say the least.

You can approach this game as a role playing experience or a guns blazing shooter or a stealthy pacifist or... you get it. You can play the usual first-person shooter or develop complex synergies in your own unique build. You can customize your appearance infinitely, discover crazy rides, play a bunch of unique arcade mini games, discover subplots within subplots and never stop exploring.

This game has been stabilized since its despicable launch and right now looks and plays terrific. I can't imagine a realistic Cyberpunk universe looking better than this. If you own a high end pc, just GO FOR IT if only to witness its gorgeous lighting and reflections. The occasional bug is there but nothing game breaking and in the long run won't matter. Not to mention the development team is still updating the game, adding and fixing stuff 4+ years later and keeping the community active with new lore and photo contests or other gimmicks for hardcore fans.

A huge bonus is that the DLC is one of the best released; a compelling narrative with lots of different options, a higher Character Level Ceiling with a ton of new upgrades in weapons and cyberware and a whole bunch of new sidequests, gigs, vehicles and areas to explore.

Both the main game and the DLC can be replayed over and over and approached in different story-related choices or playstyles and feel refreshing and rewarding like a new experience.

Oh, and the soundtrack is NUTS. The game has been accused of being just a GTA clone with futuristic gear, but in reality its art style and sound design support the game's aesthetic perfectly to set it apart not only from GTA but also from the other genre defining titles like DEUS EX, exploring similar themes with a whole different approach.

There is so much to love here, there will definitely be something for you. Don't forget to grab the free bonus contect while at it (the original soundtrack included).",True,Strategy

Cyberpunk 2077,I can't believe i have waited this long to play this game. Amazing characters and story. After finishing the game felt this weird void in me.

It was magical like the feeling of watching LotR for the first time.,True,Strategy
Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since launch, and I have to say—this game is now one of my all-time favorites. CD Projekt Red put in the work, and it really shows. If you love cyberpunk aesthetics, deep stories, and a world that feels alive, this is a must-play.

Night City is insane. The level of detail, the atmosphere, the way the city feels lived-in—it’s everything I wanted from a cyberpunk world. The neon lights, the shady alleyways, the high-tech skyscrapers, and the different districts all have their own unique feel. Walking through the streets, hearing conversations, and watching the chaos unfold around you makes it feel like a real place. It’s easy to get lost just exploring and soaking it all in.

The main story is fantastic, and the choices you make actually matter. Playing as V, trying to navigate the mess of Night City while dealing with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves absolutely nailed the role) makes for an unforgettable experience. The game doesn’t hold your hand, and it throws a lot of moral dilemmas at you.

But what really makes the game special are the side characters. Panam, Judy, River, Kerry—they all feel like real people with their own problems and dreams. Some of the side quests are just as good, if not better, than the main storyline. The writing is just top-tier, and I found myself really invested in the characters and their stories.

The Phantom Liberty DLC takes everything great about Cyberpunk 2077 and turns it up even more. New missions, new characters (Idris Elba’s character Solomon Reed is my favourite), and new gear make this expansion worth every second. The espionage and action elements add a fresh twist, making it feel like a cyberpunk spy movie. If you already love the game, Phantom Liberty is a no-brainer.

Combat is a blast. Gunplay feels smooth, and melee combat is actually fun now. Hacking is one of my favorite parts—being able to take down enemies by messing with their cyberware or turning their own turrets against them never gets old. You can play this game however you want—sneaky netrunner, melee-focused street samurai, guns-blazing mercenary—it’s all viable, and it’s all fun.

Cyberware adds even more variety. You can install upgrades that let you jump higher, slow down time, or even rip enemies apart with Mantis Blades. The skill tree has been revamped too, making character progression way more rewarding.

Building your version of V is one of the best parts. Whether it’s how your character looks, what weapons you use, or what cyberware you install, there’s a ton of freedom to play how you want. The choices you make feel meaningful, and every build feels unique.

The music in this game is just perfect. Whether you’re walking through the streets, driving through the Badlands, or getting into a firefight, the soundtrack always fits the mood. The voice acting is fantastic across the board, and the ambient sounds of the city make it feel truly alive.

Visually, this game is stunning. With ray tracing and all the graphical updates, Night City looks breathtaking. Performance-wise, it’s night and day compared to launch—smooth, optimized, and finally what it was meant to be. If you’re playing on a decent PC or a next-gen console, you’re in for a visual treat.

Cyberpunk 2077 has gone from a troubled launch to one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played. The story, the world, the characters, the combat—it all comes together beautifully now. CD Projekt Red really turned things around, and if you love sci-fi, cyberpunk settings, or just great storytelling, you owe it to yourself to play this game.",True,Strategy

Me fez refletir, me diverti com inúmeras interações com personagens bem construídos, e a narrativa é simplesmente de tirar o fôlego, com reviravoltas incríveis e de muito bom gosto.

Além disso, como apaixonado por arte, fiquei impressionado com o quanto esse jogo entrega nesse aspecto.

O único ponto fraco, na minha opinião, é o balanceamento dos inimigos. Joguei no hard e senti que eles são muito fracos, enquanto os chefes da campanha são absurdamente mais fortes que os Cyberpsicopatas. No entanto, sei que existem mods que ajudam a equilibrar esse aspecto.

Cyberpunk 2077," this game quickly climbed into my TOP 5 games of all time. 
Cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games I have ever played, the graphics with PT and music are fantastic and the world building is something else.

It's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. I can feel the unique culture from within Night City, the different groups/gangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of Cyberpunk

the game bugs have significantly decreased and  story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the Phantom Liberty expansion, LEVELS. The characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side Keanu Reeves? Not to mention Idris Elba.

Really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunning/hacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours.

Character customisation is just a delight and I enjoyed creating my different people.

Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is like a dystopian fever dream where you play as a mercenary named V, who’s basically a walking IKEA catalog of cyberware and poor life choices. The game is set in Night City, a place so grim it makes Blade Runner look like a Disney vacation. It’s a world where corporations rule, everyone has a tragic backstory, and your best friend is a gun that occasionally talks to you.

The story is a rollercoaster of emotions—mostly despair, with a side of existential dread. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll question why you thought stealing a priceless relic from a megacorp was a good idea. Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves, who’s basically playing himself but angrier) is your digital ghost roommate, and he’s either the best or worst part of the game, depending on how much you enjoy being called a ""gonk"" every five minutes.

Pros:

Night City is stunning when it’s not glitching into the void.

The soundtrack slaps harder than a cyberpsycho on a rampage.

Judy Alvarez exists. That’s it. That’s the pro.

Cons:

Bugs. So many bugs. I once saw a car phase through a building and honestly, it felt lore-accurate.

The AI is about as smart as a toaster. Cops will literally spawn behind you, yell ""STOP RIGHT THERE,"" and then forget you exist.

You’ll spend more time customizing your character than actually seeing them (thanks, first-person view).

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a mess, but it’s our mess. It’s like dating someone toxic but hot—you know it’s bad for you, but you can’t look away. 7/10, would get cyberpsychosis again.",True,Strategy

Cyberpunk 2077,"The game is absolutely awesome! I have not been this hooked up to a video game for long time. I cant believe I held up so long to get it because of how this game was review bombed. It must have been over 2 years in my wishlist. Only shows how fans can be unfair sometimes.

Let's Start with Cons:
- Occasional bug and crash to desktop (happened maybe 2-3 times that the game flatlined). You can sometimes encounter wrecks of cars on the road which are not actual obstacles and cannot be interacted with, you can just drive through them like they were not there. From time to time you will see a flying object, levitating NPC or a car in really strange position.
- AI is superb dumb - police is the dumbest - even if you have 5 stars at being wanted they will forget about you in a minute or two if they cant see you. Even if you are just around a pillar and can see 5 policemen looking for you and slowly approaching your position then all of a sudden timer beeps, the stars start to flash for a few seconds and bang you are not wanted anymore. You go out of the pillar and policemen do not recognise you anymore even tho you just butchered a few dozens (or hundreds?) of their colleagues. I wish this could be addressed as it breaks immersion and is just straight out idiotic. Or when you enter the mission they stop chasing you. Not only police is stupid, all the enemies if they lose sight of you for a minute or something they lose interest or just stand there waiting to be smoked.
- You get too OP. I get that you are supposed to be a Night City Legend but the highest difficulty level should  be more challenging especially a little bit later when you get more cyberware and good weapons. For now game is only challenging on higher difficulties for the first few hours. Maybe until level 10 or 15. From level 40 you barely die and can just storm through 20 or 30 opponents. Only very occasionally you will die. 
- No flying machines that can be interacted with of piloted is a little disappointing in futuristic game like this. There should be flying cars or helicopters that could be piloted.

Pros:
- Story is amazing
- Most of the side quests are great and engaging. Even the repetitive quests like kill or steal are great because every time they are in different setting building etc and the gunplay never gets boring
- Gunplay is just great. Feels right maybe except for technical weapons which are not very fun. Also Melee weapons seems to be under-powered to compare them to shotgun for example
- NPCS are amazing so many memorable characters. 
- Voice acting is spot on
- Choices are good however there should be more 
- Romance option is thre and it is exciting
- Graphics is top notch
- Cars and driving feels great. Every car can be driven from 1st person perspective and every car has unique design with wheel radio and all interiors. How amazing is that?
- V - the protagonist is a cool interesting guy you can chose your starting position too
- Johnny Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves. How cool is this!
- Beautiful and alive city with so many people in and cars. So many unique districts 
- A lot of places where you can fight with lowlives just for fun without needing any quest
- Such a great music and variety. So many different radio stations
- You get a mobile phone! And can call or text other NPC! Cool
- Leveling system is good and rewarding.
- Quests are plentiful
- Almost no copy and paste buildings, cellars or locations. Everything feels unique

So much love was put into this game it is amazing. For me 9/10 - I dont mind an occasional bug but if they worked on poor AI and AI realism then it would be strong 9.5/10 for me. If they added extreme difficulty level with more challenge it would have been 10/10

I've enjoyed almost everything about playing cyberpunk, the DLC was a crazy good story on it's own... I've had more then enough side missions and places to explore and I'm heading toward endgame with around 70+ hours of gameplay on my save file.

The game offers exceptional morally-ambiguous storytelling, immersive dystopian world-building, and extremely fun FPS gameplay. The versatility of the different cybernetic builds you can choose to focus on for combat alongside the weight of the choices you're forced to make HOOKED me into this game. Exploring Night City, engaging with the NPCs, the music, and the graphics are also amazing aspects of this game. I'd recommend getting the base game with the PL expansion as it feels like a seamless extension to the entirety of Cyberpunk. It also goes on sale frequently which is 100% worth the purchase.

Cyberpunk 2077,"I was barely at all interested in this game after seeing the dumpster fire of a launch back in 2020. I remember sitting in a discord call with a buddy, watching him play on release day- and seeing how horrible it was ruined any urge to even play it.
A couple years later, around 2022, I got the game on sale, tried playing it, and didn't enjoy it. I ultimately refunded the game and moved on. That was until earlier last year, when I saw a lightly used copy of the game for the Xbox Series X in a gamestop for 15 bucks. I figured it was worth a shot since it was so cheap, plus having the physical media was cool.

I finally got past the ""boring"" beginning part of the game, and it opened up to be this insanely beautiful experience. I have not had this much fun playing a game in a long time. For months this was the only game I touched, and it was well worth it. Back then, I wouldn't have told you to go a mile close to the storepage, now? I can't recommend this game enough. For how emotionless the city is, and how scary the world appears to be, it's hard not to grow appreciation for V, Johnny, and all of the other people you meet that burst with color. I can't remember being so heartbroken after beating the game since RDR2. I seriously sat in my chair for a solid 30 minutes in silence to process everything. It sounds like a loser thing to do but, I seriously fell in love with the game.

While I can't blame anybody for being hesitant about buying it, they truly have polished it and turned it into what the game should've been when it released. While I can't justify the major f*ckup from CDPR, the fact that they actually fixed it instead of moving on earned them my respect for sure. Aside from that, this game is easily one of my favorite games ever. Nothing in this game was boring, at all. I've beat it once on both PS5 and XSX, and have been achievement hunting and trying to 100% the game on PC for 94 hours. You will love this game, I promise. Give it a shot.

Cyberpunk 2077,"It is a rare thing for a game to transcend mere entertainment and become an experience—one that leaves an imprint on your soul. There are bad games, okay games, good games, great games, and even legendary games. But then there are the few that redefine what gaming can be. The ones that, when the credits roll, leave you feeling like a part of yourself has been left behind in that world.

For years, I held Red Dead Redemption 2 in that regard—a masterpiece, an unforgettable journey. And now, after all the struggles, all the setbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 has earned its place beside it. This game had one of the most disastrous launches in history, rightfully criticized to no end. It was broken, nearly unplayable. And yet, against all odds, CD Projekt Red refused to let it die.

I've never been so attached to an in game fantasy character before, but there's always a first time for everything. The writing is great and I'm proud of the devs for doing the right thing and taking huge steps to fix their game.. I can see myself playing this game for years to come.

Cyberpunk 2077,"I’ll be honest—Cyberpunk 2077 had a rough start. But fast-forward to today, and it's a completely different game. CD Projekt Red stuck with it, refining and improving every aspect, turning Night City into one of the most immersive open worlds ever created.

🔹 Incredible Storytelling: The main narrative and side quests are top-tier, packed with emotional depth, memorable characters, and tough choices that actually matter.
🔹 Vibrant Open World: Night City feels alive—neon-lit streets, bustling markets, shady back alleys—every district has its own personality.
🔹 Deep RPG Elements: Perks, cyberware, and builds feel meaningful, allowing for a playstyle that fits YOU. Want to be a stealthy netrunner? A cyber-enhanced brawler? A gunslinging merc? The choice is yours.
🔹 Combat & Driving Overhaul (2.0 Update): Gunplay feels snappier, melee is brutal, and driving is finally smooth and responsive (with actual police chases!).
🔹 Phantom Liberty Expansion: If you love spy thrillers and action-packed missions, this DLC is an absolute must. Idris Elba’s performance is phenomenal!

Yes, Cyberpunk 2077 had its flaws at launch, but what matters is where it is now—a breathtaking, gripping, and polished RPG that truly delivers on its promise. If you were hesitant before, NOW is the perfect time to jump in.

The Story is amazing, the NPCs have so much personality and are unique and you just have to love them! I cared deeply for the side-quests. Even though I normally get burned out rather fast in other games when it comes to optional content, I simply had to help these people. No burnout in sight!

And the Gameplay is a blast as well! Nothing better than zooming across the map and slicing baddies up, feeling like a god~ 
You can customize your version of V however you want, being able to change your mind almost at any point! And due to that, the replayability is also very great in my opinion

Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game that fully delivers on its promise of an immersive, futuristic RPG experience. From its stunning open world to its engaging gameplay and memorable characters, everything comes together in a way that makes it one of the best games I’ve played.

World & Atmosphere – Night City is Incredible
The world is absolutely breathtaking. Night City feels alive, with insane attention to detail, neon-lit streets, and a dark, dystopian atmosphere that pulls you in completely. Exploring the world is pure joy, whether you’re driving through the city or sneaking through high-tech buildings.

Story & Characters – A Strong Narrative
The main story is fantastic, with plenty of twists, emotional moments, and tough decisions. V is a great protagonist, and their story is engaging from start to finish. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) adds a unique dynamic, and his interactions with V are a highlight of the game.

The side characters are well-written, with standout moments from Panam, Judy, River, and Rogue. Side quests don’t feel like filler—they add depth to the world and its inhabitants, making every interaction feel meaningful.

Gameplay – Fun and Engaging
The combat is excellent—gunplay feels great, hacking adds depth, and cyberware upgrades allow for tons of customization. Whether you prefer stealth, brute force, or a mix of both, the game lets you approach missions however you want.

Driving feels smooth, and exploring Night City never gets old. The RPG mechanics are well-done, with a good balance of progression, skill upgrades, and gear customization.

Final Thoughts – A Must-Play
Despite its rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has been polished into an excellent RPG. The world, story, and gameplay all come together to make an immersive and unforgettable experience. If you love open-world games with deep storytelling and exciting gameplay, this is definitely worth playing.

A fantastic game, and one I highly recommend!",True,Strategy

Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpeak 2077 - Das beste Story-Game, was ich jemals gespielt habe!

Ja, das Spiel ist katastrophal gelauncht, aber dieses Review bezieht sich auf den Jetzt-Zustand auf PC und das GAME IST GEFIXXT.

Cyberpunk überzeugt mit seiner herausragenden Optik. Die Leuchreklamen, die Werbung, das Setting und vor allem die hohe Anzahl an NPCs lassen die Stadt (Night City) lebendig erscheinen. Es ist bemerkenswert, wie CD Projekt es geschafft hat, eine First-Person-City so massiv rüberkommen zu lassen. Man fühlt sich wirklich wie in einer dystopischen, futuristischen Megastadt, in der die Corps mehr Macht als Behörden oder Regierungen haben. Ein Grafikspektakel, das es so definitiv noch nicht gegeben hat. Die Welt so detailliert und immersiv, dass man sich wie ein Zeitzeuge vorkommt, wobei die Performance nicht schlecht ist. Die Werbung, die quasi überall zu finden ist, beinhaltet geilen Erwachsenenhumor und scheint darzustellen, wo wir uns als Gesellschaft hinbewegen. Im Allgemeinen ist das Setting von Cyberpunk sehr interessant. Dynamisches Wetter und vor Allem das Night-Life machen das Spiel nochmals atmosphärischer.

Night City ist nicht einfach nur eine dahingeklatschte Stadt, sondern hat Struktur. Es gibt verschiedene Viertel, in denen man verschiedene Leute antrifft. Pacifica ist zwar paradisisch, jedoch traut sich dort kein Polizist hin und es herrscht pures Chaos. Verlassene Shopping Malls, Skyscraper usw. Am Copo Plaza leben die Konzerner, die Reichen. Wolkenkratzer, fliegene Taxis und große Straßen. Die Badlands, eine Wüste, die Night City umgibt, ist voller Normaden und Plünderer, die die Menschen bedrohen. Jeder einzelne Distrikt ist verschieden und hat viel Neues zum Entdecken.

Es gibt so viel zutun, so viele Anpassungsmöglichkeiten. Das fängt schon bei den äußerlichen Merkmalen der Charaktererstellung an, wo man wirklich alles (auch das Genital) beliebig anpassen kann. Eine quasi unendlich große Auswahl an Kleidungsstile. Außerdem kann man sich mehrere Wohnungen (von billiig bis zu hoch luxuriös) kaufen und immer wieder Neues entdecken. Ein Porsche in Night City um 2077? - Gibt es, in gleich zwei Varianten und noch viele andere Autos. Genial ist auch, dass man diese zu jeder Zeit zu sich rufen kann (Taste V). Wer aber von langem Fahren aus GTA5 genervt ist, wird hier seinen Spaß haben, da es Quick-Travel gibt.

Hacken ist einfach nur grandios und simple gelöst. Man kann Gegner entweder leise und auffällig umbringen oder mit viel Aufruhr. Die ""Quickhacks"" sind einfach zu verstehen und es gibt so viele von ihnen, dass ich auch nach 70h immer noch nicht alle kenne. Autos kontrollieren, Gegner zum Suizid ""hacken"" und Granaten über gehackte Kameras aktivieren. Man kann seine Quickhacks erweitern und modifzieren. Waffen und Granaten gibt es auch ohne Ende. 

Bei den sogenannten Ripperdocs kann man seinen Körper anpassen und upgraden, wodurch man Fähigkeiten wie Double Jump oder Klingen statt Fäuste freischalten kann. Das Kämpfen ist also super individuell und fördert dutzende Spielstile. Looten kann man mögen oder nicht, aber das Lootsystem in diesem Spiel ist einfach nur perfekt. Allgemein ist die Menüführung extrem einfach und man findet sich schnell zurecht.

Der Skill-Tree ist einer der komplexesten, die ich je gesehen habe, was aber gut ist. Man hat verschiedene Bereiche, auf die man seinen Charakter leveln kann. So z.B. Hacken, Weaponhandling oder Movement. Jeder Bereich beinhaltet um die 30 Upgrades, die man frei wählen kann. Es gibt aber auch Upgrades, die man durch reines Spielen freischaltet und nicht auswählen kann.

Es gibt viele Dinge, die man in der Open-World tun kann. Bars, Clubs, JoyToys (xD), Autorennen, Verbrecherjagden und vieles mehr.

Nun zu dem, was das Spiel zu einem wirklichen Meisterwerk macht: Die Charaktere und die Story

Die Charaktere sind tiefgreifend und jeder hat seine eigene Story, die nahezu perfekt übermittelt wird. Sie haben Emotionen in Form von Mimik und Gestik, die man in kaum einem Spiel erlebt. Das Interagieren mit den Charakteren ist ebenfalls sehr gängig gestaltet und ruft verschiedene Reaktionen hervor. Humor, Ernsthaftigkeit und Bezüge zu vorher Passiertem machen die Konversationen lebendig und unterhaltsam. Vor allem die Charaktere Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves), Jackie und Panam sind perfekt geschriebene Charaktere, die einen durch die Story begleiten.

Die Story ist das Herzstück des Spiels. Sie ist komplex, aber dennoch gut verständlich, wenn man gut aufpasst. Anders als in vielen anderen Spielen ist die Story jedoch nicht vorhersehbar, was einen sowohl schocken als auch faszinieren kann. Es gibt verschiede Anfänge der Story und verschiedene Wege, wie die Story endet. Das Auge fürs Detail hatten die Entwickler. So unterhalten sich NPCs über Geschehnisse, die durch die Story in NC passiert sind und auch Narichtensender, die man in jedem Fahrstuhl unausweichlich hört, thematisieren Story Relevantes.

Man kann Side-Gigs machen, die einen mehr in das Stadtleben eindringen lassen. Auch Nebenmissionen mit eigenen Charakteren gibt es, die sowohl spannend sind als auch dazu beitragen, die Welt von 2077 zu verstehen.

Was ich auch bemerkenswert finde, ist die Synchro, sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch. Man erkennt auf beiden Sprachen viele bekannte Synchronsprecher. Das Auge fürs Detail ist nicht nur bei der Story mit an Bord, sondern auch, wenn es um Easter Eggs, die sich auf CD Projects Spiele wie Witcher 3 beziehen, geht.

Alles in Allem für mich ein 10/10 Game, da das Setting und die Story fesselnd und einzigartig sind, die Welt von 2077 quasi unendlich lange erkundbar ist und die Charaktere. 
Absolute Kaufempfehlung, vor allem, wenn es im Sale ist. 

Das ist das Geld, jeden Euro, wert, sofern man Open-World Story Games mag. Ein vergleichbares Spiel, mit einer immersiveren Welt und tiefgreifenderen Charakteren gibt es einfach noch nicht.",True,Strategy
Cyberpunk 2077,"I can't stop jacking. I'm serious. I see a port, I have to jack it. Could be a back-alley data tap or some corp Arasaka node - I’m still jacking. Any opportunity to jack it, i do. At least I wear ICE to protect my chrome from any dirty ports. Ain’t just a habit, it’s who I am. Proud Jooner 'til the Blackwall takes me.",True,Strategy
Cyberpunk 2077,"Wow, what a game! Just about everything in this game is spot on the way I like my games to be. First of all, it ran flawlessly and I never had a single crash. There was on part of the story early on that had a bug, and its documented. I had to change a few graphics settings to get through it, but luckily it never happened again. 99% of the game is flawless.
The audio in the game is great, I played it on dolby 5.1 on my Yamaha receiver. The graphics are very impressive. It took me a bit to get the HDR set right, but other than that I got a good average fps of about 85 to 90 played on my 3440x1440 UWS using my rtx 3080ti. It looked wonderful. Ultra wide screen was done great. I didnt pick up on any artifacts like stretched screen with that.
The story is great, and the voice acting is decent. Of course Keanu Reeves is in it and he has a major role in it. His voice is all through the game as well as his likeness. The DLC is well worth the price, if you get this game be sure to purchase that as well. I think there are alternate endings to this, and I liked mine ok. The ending was realistic and satisfying because of that. 
If you like role playing games that focus on the story then this is a game for you. The gameplay itself is really fun too. Its got a good amount of cutscenes, but there is plenty of free roaming in the city and lots of side quests. I played every quest there was I think, and got 148 hours out of the game. Its well worth what you spend.",True,Strategy

The game has changed drastically over the past four years — I would call it the game of the decade.",True,Strategy

Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that, every time I opened it, hit every dopamine and serotonin receptor. I was completely immersed in a world full of dystopian complexities, rebellion against the system, and characters who, whether bound by friendship, love, or pure hatred, all leave their mark on Night City. Some forge deep connections, others clash violently, but in the end, every action—every presence—shapes the world around them.

If you enjoyed Watch Dogs 2 or Mirror’s Edge, you’d understand that I’m a sucker for kinship-core themes. The way the world and its characters interact isn’t about heroes or villains—it’s just survival in a world of moral absurdity. If visualized, it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting—chaotic, layered, and unpredictable.

Running along that edge, you witness the beauty and tragedy of those who push themselves to the brink—some reaching glory, others barely scratching it before falling. In Night City, it’s common practice to live off poisons—sex, drugs, anything to numb the pain or slip away from a world that no longer feels like home. A world already claimed by others, where your misfortune is just another commodity to exploit.

The edge is the only way to truly live—and to die. But those who die loud enough, those who burn bright before they fade, become more than just memories. They become legends. They are the sparks that ignite humanity’s resistance to oppression, the embers that refuse to be snuffed out.

And that, to me, is mesmerizing—or dare I say, breathtaking.",True,Strategy
Cyberpunk 2077,"Highly recommend, great story line, multiple endings, relationships and more. I really wish there was more tbh. I played this on ps5 and wanted to see how it ran on my PC so I bought it again. The graphics are amazing. There are multiple endings and your choices affect the outcome. Not for kids, so parents be warned there if full on nudity in the game. 
 Wish I could find more games like this. Cannot get enough of this game.",True,Strategy
Cyberpunk 2077,"I really wanted to like this game, but I guess it's just not for me. The character customization is much better than any other game I've played, so I'll give it that. But the story was hard to get invested in, the gameplay is just okay enough to be entertaining but not as in depth as I'd like for the genre, it's way too easy to become OP and stops being challenging around the 2/5 mark even if you set it to a higher difficulty... Realistically, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. I hope anyone else that tries it likes it more than I did, and you likely will; This game's gotta be marked overwhelmingly positive for a reason.",True,Strategy

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition,"It's a good game, of course, it's an AOE. 
The strategy is good, but not so well balanced between civilizations.
The civs themselves are fun and graphics are nice.
Many new mechanics and ways to play. Makes you want to learn and practice more.
The sequel that AOE 3 should have been.

That said, I have a few comments:

* It's always rushed and fast paced.
* The civilizations are COMPLETELY different from each other. It makes it more real, I agree, but really hard to keep the necessary crazy pace with a civ you're not used to. 
* You kinda have no time to enjoy little things in the game, as you need to focus on build orders and counters.

Everyone that says this is the greatest game and a great upgrade, is a paid actor or something, because I have given this game repeated chance and it is just flat out, not fun, slow, boring, unoriginal, direct attempt to do what Empire Earth 3 did, just make an awful game that feels nothing like Empire Earth, and in this case, nothing like Age of Empires.

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition,"I've played a lot of hours but the game, while it is fun at a core level, has insanely bad balance issues. Certain builds, like English early men-at-arms builds, have no counter. Even if you were much better than the English player, the ONLY way you can stop it is by also playing English and build early men-at-arms. Certain nations, such as France, are designed to be unbeatable unless you are extremely more skilled than your opponent. An RTS is meant to be a skill based game, while I really want to like aoe4 and it has good features, it is not a skill based game. Certain nations are just objectively better than others.

But the biggest add up to me is those mini docs they added between the chapters, teaching you about life in the dark age, the tactics, the technology etc...This makes the game not only a game but a teaching experience.

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition,"One of my first gaming experiences was playing Age of Mythology and right from the start i used to love strategy games.
I played Starcraft II for years and eventually i heard about an new upcoming Age of Empires 4.

I admit, after the hour i wasn't completely sold (mind you, it was day 1, back in 2021) but i [b] INSTANTLY [/b] knew, that this game got something special. After a few more hours, it clicked and i was in for one of my best experiences in terms of RTS Gaming.
After over three years and over 700 hours playtime, I'll give you some insight in my thoughts about the game:



[h3] GAMEPLAY [/h3] ( 9 / 10 )
[list]
[*] the most accessible Age game so far. Good inputs, very responsive, good pathfinding
[*] very interesting civs! could be a bit overwhelming for new players (talking about multiplayer) BUT
[*] multiplayer is a lot of fun! nice community and a reasonably good match making, if you ask me
[*] balancing all those civs is obviously hard, but Relic managed to get the game into a good spot. Archers may be a but overtuned at the time of my review, but nothing major. I would say, that - right now - AOE4 is in its best spot considering balance and viability of different strategys (fast push, turteling, fast age-up, raiding, etc.) [/list]


[h3] SOUND [/h3] ( 10 / 10 )
[list]
[*] TOP NOTCH!!! the more you get into it, the more you realise how FRICKIN aswsome the soundstage is. you can localise everything based on sounds, the voiceacting is SUPERB, with very much love for the certain languages.
[*] for further information, i strongly suggest the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ2IOj_xYgA [/list]


[h3] GRAPHIC [/h3] ( 8 / 10 )
[list]
[*] good graphics in terms of strategy games
[*] good redability of units etc. (!)
[*] sometimes units looking a bit ""washed out"", but only if you scroll on top of them [/list]


[h3] SINGLEPLAYER [/h3] ( 8 / 10 )
[list]
[*] i play AOE4 almost only for the multiplayer, but i like the campaign as well. would have loved an age of mythology-type camapign tho (in game cutscenes, storytelling etc.) Instead, relic went for a documentation type of campaign, which is fine. Would have wished for something else tho, but thats subjective i guess [/list]


[h3] DLC + FUTURE CONTENT [/h3] ( 9 / 10 )

we already got 1 major DLC, which was good value for the money if you ask me. 
We got 6 new civs to play with (2 new civs + 4 variant civs, which are altered civs that are already in the game), which were fun to play with. 
On top of that, they gave us a new campaign (which i didnt play yet).
Amazing DLC, hence the 9 out of 10.

Recently were promised 2 more DLC in 2025, so we got new stuff for the future as well.




[h2] VERDICT [/h2]

Carefully crafted map with different presets that you can enjoy playing against AIs. Even with slightly randomized geography, LOL. For instance, the mountains have some narrow paths creating additional threats to the defense.

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition,"I gotta admit, i was a hardcore AOE2 fan. this game won me over in so many ways.

Gameplay aside, the game looks and sounds incredible! I love the graphics, I like that each civ has different architectures. At the end of each game, I love looking at what my base looks like. The terrain is gorgeous, and you can customize the biome in skirmishes. Some unique upgrades will change the appearances on your units. The sound design is out of this world. I love hearing the marching and galloping of your military. The music is gorgeous and not only unique to each civ, but there are different tracks for each age. Languages your units speaks changes with each age as well and you get to witness the evolution of language through the ages. The historical detail for the civ bonuses make me happy as a history nerd.

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition,"Age of Empires IV – A Childhood Dream Brought Back to Life

I grew up playing Age of Empires, spending hours building empires, strategizing battles, and reliving history in the best way a kid could—through an epic RTS. So when Age of Empires IV was announced, I was both excited and nervous. Could it really capture that same magic?

Turns out, it absolutely does. The game feels like a love letter to longtime fans while still bringing enough fresh ideas to keep things exciting. The classic gameplay is still there—gathering resources, building armies, and outmaneuvering your enemies—but everything is more refined, more responsive, and just… smoother. The civilizations feel unique, and I love how each one has its own strengths and quirks, making every match feel different.

One of my favorite things is the campaign. It’s not just a series of battles; it’s like playing through a historical documentary, complete with real-world footage and narration that gives weight to every mission. The level of detail is insane, and it adds a layer of immersion that I didn’t even know I wanted.

And of course, multiplayer is as intense as ever. Whether you’re teaming up with friends or going head-to-head with strangers, every match is a test of skill and strategy. The developers have done a great job keeping the game balanced and fresh with updates, which is something I really appreciate.

For anyone who grew up with this series like I did, Age of Empires IV isn’t just a game—it’s a time machine back to those golden days of staying up late, just one more match before bed. If you loved the originals, this is everything you could hope for. And if you’re new? Well, you’re in for something special.

Situation is similar to CoH3 - sound is bad, better than in CoH3 but still bad - everything is muffled and put through some flat filter so in the moment of action you can only recognize swords clashing (sounds like one fork is sliding on another) and peasant production. Sometimes you can hear gunpowder weapons but it would be very strange to not hear it. 
During action everything is made so that you have zero will to micro and you just ""whatever, will make more units, will make more resources..."". Starting from sounds and unit responses and ending with music and micro control - everything wants to make you quit this game. Music itself is good but how it's put is not fitting the situation, you either want to sleep or switch it off completely.
Basically, anything you can mention in this game is made better in Age of Mytholody: Retold.

Campaign is decent, quality is pretty high in this case, especially with historical videos.
Gameplay wise all strategy games feel like ""rock-paper-scissors"", AoE4 feels like ""rock-paper"".

In Crusader units will ""compress"" on top of each other, which is smooth but physically not realistic.

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition,"AoE2 but different. Same RTS soul, new rules.

Fewer civs (for now), but each one plays COMPLETELY differently. Not just +2 in a random stadistic, actually real gameplay changes, each civ plays wildly different. No team bonuses, no house walling, no fish traps, and no dodging arrows. And some aoe2 players would hate this (including me) but NO hilll bonus here.

Winning isn’t just about destroying everything. Lose your landmarks? You’re out. Ignore sacred sites? Ten minutes and it’s game over. Wonders? Actually a real win condition. Trade exists in 1v1, you can build TCs in Feudal, and scouts grab sheep just by walking near them.

Food matters more. Boars hit back hard, food don’t rot, and farms magically replenish without costing wood. Infantry can build siege on the battlefield, mangonel shots can be dodged, but arrows? They always hit.

Towers get weapon upgrades, walls can be climbed, and monks don’t snipe single units, they Wololo everything in a big circle if they are carrying a relic. TCs hit like a truck, and vision is limited, you can’t see through trees unless you have a scout.

It’s AoE2’s rebellious cousin; smarter, sleeker, and objectively the better-designed game. The mechanics are more polished, the gameplay is more consistent, and it aligns better with real-world history. It’s a modern evolution of the franchise that feels cohesive and well thought out.

Red Dead Redemption 2,"[h1]A Masterpiece of Gaming[/h1]
Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute masterpiece and a must-play for any gamer. From its breathtakingly beautiful open world to its captivating story, this game does everything right.

The attention to detail in the world is astonishing — whether you're riding across the vast plains, fishing in the calm rivers, or simply walking through the bustling towns, every corner of the world feels alive and full of character. The landscapes, from snowy mountains to dense forests, are some of the most visually stunning I've seen in a game.

The narrative is emotional, gripping, and full of unforgettable characters. Arthur Morgan, the protagonist, is one of the best-written characters in gaming history. His journey is a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and you'll find yourself deeply invested in his fate.

The gameplay is smooth, with a lot of variety. Whether you're hunting, engaging in intense gunfights, or just interacting with the world, everything feels immersive. The dynamic weather, the day-night cycle, and the random events that occur make each playthrough feel unique.

If you're a fan of open-world games or westerns, this is a must-have. Rockstar has truly outdone themselves with Red Dead Redemption 2. I spent hours getting lost in the world, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This game has set a new standard for what we can expect from video games, and I can't recommend it enough.",True,Strategy

At the beginning of the game, Arthur is a tough cowboy, an outlaw through and through. But as the story goes on, he starts looking at his life from a different angle because of certain circumstances (those who’ve played know what I mean)

Rockstar outdid themselves here with the amount detail put into everything such as the animation, side missions, journal entries, artworks, dialogue, the honor system and especially the design of the world and environments which stuck you in.

This game's characters are astronomical. From Arthur, Dutch, John, Charles, Sadie, Micah, Hosea, Abigail, etc. Every Single Character is simply amazing and will make you feel attached unlike no other games. 

You feel their hates.
You feel their joy.
You feel their sadness.
You feel their greed.
You feel their soul.

GOSH the music is an experience of its own. We got D'Angelo finally making music, Daniel Lanios gentle and atmospheric sound, Woody's Jackson high-octane beats. All of which accumulate to you unable to move from your chair to further play and feel.
The many tracks feel as if Arthur Morgan hears them in real time.

There are very few games that are in class with the amount of world building RD2 has, what I've said is only the crumbs to this masterpiece of a game. The only ones I can think are on level with this world building in my head are Disco Elysium, Super Metroid, Hollow Knight and Elden Ring.

Arthur Morgan is the best video game character of all time, hands down. The way the game makes you sit with him and shows you how he feels both through writing, gameplay and missions is genuinely a marvel and I don't think I'll quite play or experience anything like this ever again.

It took me a while to get into it, the start is slow and feels a little aimless at first. My girlfriend recommended I push on with it and I am so glad I did.

Red Dead Redemption 2,"I don't usually play through games twice, especially open world titles but Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the best games I've ever experienced. It was incredible back on the PS4 in 2018 and is still remarkable all these years later on PC. 

At 75% off in the recent sale, this was a fantastic purchase. It took me just over 35 hours to finish the main story once more, but in reality there is probably over 100 hours of original content here. The world is amazing, the story is thrilling all the way to the end and Arthur Morgan remains one of the most unforgettable protagonists in gaming history. 

Not a massive fan of the survival aspects like eating, hunting and tonics but those are easy to avoid if you want to skip some of the immersive additions. Money is a bit easy to come by also so things like robberies aren't really required. Fans of role playing may certainly get absorbed with all these extra gameplay features for a more realistic experience. 

The controls are extremely clunky and awkward at times though, especially indoors or trying to perform certain hold-button actions. Even with a gamepad, it can be rather cumbersome with a feel of input lag or general unresponsiveness. I didn't bother with the already-abandoned online portion of the game but that is another option to explore. 

Overall, this is an essential purchase especially for first time players and if you are itching to try it on PC after playing previous on console, it's definitely worth grabbing in the sale as it represents exceptional value for money at a discount.",True,Strategy

It is Hands down the absolute GOAT. I can Not believe how detailed and in depth this Game is. The vibrance and Deepness this world brings, is totally unmatched. With now way over 200 Hours and almost 20 on the Steam Deck(to simply enjoy this Game on the Go,btw runs amazing) , i am Still finding new stuff every single day . There is Just so much stuff going on and i Just wanna experience everything. Also the mysterys, the treasures and collectibles in this Game are Not as easy and obvious Hidden , Like in almost every other Game. But enough with That.
The Story around Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang ist absolutely amazing , while rdr1 was amazing too(Love Marston and the ongoing Story)and It was so ahead of Its Time, this Just really feels so complete. I seriously have Trouble playing and enjoying other Games , cause it all feels dull, compared to rdr2. 
I think it was perfect for me Not coming into this absolute masterpiece, before i am almost turning 30 now. I think i needed to grow myself, to really grasp around the greatness of this Game , it's Story and it's world.

The world in Red dead 2 is astonishingly beautiful, almost close to real life, and the graphics are equivalent to, if not, better than the current AAA games' standards.

Red Dead Redemption 2,"This game is literally a fever dream of cowboy romanticism. Riding through dusty sunlit walleys, listening to a harmonica at a sundown, purple skies, storms, distant flickers of lanters, winds through threes, this world breathes on its own. So many times i felt like I'm not the main character, but the whole world is. Rockstar really knows how to make games feel alive. Everything feels slow, it's not type of game that holds your hand, things just happen, and when you start caring and being involved you realise it's not only about the story, it's about the whole idea of the West. Moments where you realise all characters have their own lives, you see struggles in them, things unfold with or without you. Every single town, every road, all feels so so real. And what hurts is the realty that time changes people, and you loose those same people. 

I love the idea that every choise that you make is somewhat heavy, not because the game is like ''THIS WILL AFFECT THE STORY IN THIS WAY OR THAT WAY'', but because you constantly wrestle with who you are and who you could be, because you're an outlaw, and sadly halfway through the game I realized you don't try to save West, you kinda witness it's funeral, and your journey isn't just a personal one, you just witness an era that was actually never ment to last. Gangs fall apart, dreams collapse, people go and West fades as well.

Red Dead Redemption 2,"this game is, by far, my favourite game of all time. nothing will ever top it for me and i will recommend it to everyone who asks. however, it does have an incredibly frustrating habit of crashing as soon as i load it up every now and then (last time it did this was 8mo ago), leading me to uninstall it & then redownload it... which takes 12hrs for me. very annoying but not enough to stop me from loving it",True,Strategy
Red Dead Redemption 2,"I have had this game for a year and 5 months and have 271 hours on it, I can start by saying it is my favorite game. If you are not convinced if you should buy it or not, let me help you. I will be sharing my points of view on the story, online play, graphics, and some experiences.

First of all, the story of the game may seem long at first, try not to skip through it and don't get spoiled. Take your time to enjoy it at it's fullest. My mistake was trying to finish it as fast as possible. I only did the main quests and did not focus on the secondary ones. The story is well thought and each action has an impact on it. It can be very random at times but that's what is interesting. The more you spend time in story mode the more you get attached to the characters and are really brought in the universe. The whole plot is so captivating. 

Secondly, online play. At the start it can seem very confusing, it was for me. When I started I had spawned in a forest and had no idea what to do, I stole a horse and ended up in Valentine where I instantly got killed. That made me go back to story mode and I came back to online after 5 months. Make sure to use a VPN if you do not want people to see where you are. People cannot access your ip address unless they are modding the game. Most servers have at least a modder in them. Most of the modders are just trying to ruin other's gaming experience by using diverse weird actions (like making your horse shoot fire out of it's a$$ or simply just crashing your game). But some modders can be nice and leave you in peace.  Once you are advanced in online it may become boring but the character costumisation can be fun. You can join a posse and fight another one. There's lot's of events in which you can participate in. There's roles which you can develop and get rewards . Or you can just join a huge fight in Valentine.

The graphics are amazing, especially if you take in account that the game was released in 2019. Even if you run the game in optimal, you get to benefit of great graphics and a beautiful scenery. Sometimes I just like to stand somewhere and enjoy the views (I should probably be doing this in real life).  The graphics bring the game such realism which makes the gaming experience wonderful. In story mode it just makes it even more great than it already is. 

I have met a lot of great people through this game, even if the ages can be very different everyone just gets along. Probably one of my best gaming experiences was to integrate a group of red dead redemption players which has only last for some months but it was the funnest times. So many of our inside jokes have stuck to me and I would like to thank them for the times together. 

I definitely recommend this game, hope this helps!",True,Strategy

The vibes are absolutely amazing. Riding through vast open landscapes as the sun sets, watching the light shimmer off a distant river, or camping under a sky full of stars — every moment in RDR2 feels alive and immersive. The world is rich with atmosphere, and Rockstar has outdone themselves in creating an environment that feels authentic and lived-in.

The story is deeply emotional and brilliantly paced, with characters that feel real, each with their own struggles and personalities. Arthur Morgan's journey is one of the best-written narratives I've experienced in gaming, and by the end, I felt genuinely connected to the characters and their world.

Beyond the story, simply existing in the game world is a joy. Hunting, fishing, playing poker in a dusty saloon, trying your luck at the blackjack tables (where you’ll probably lose more money than you make, but hey, that’s authenticity for you), or just wandering through a misty forest—the game rewards you for slowing down and soaking in the ambiance.

If you appreciate games that take their time and build a world that feels tangible, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. The visuals, the sound design, and the incredible attention to detail make this a must-play. It's not just a game; it's a work of art. 10/10.",True,Strategy
Red Dead Redemption 2,"RDR2 might be my favorite video game ever- no, favorite art piece ever. I'm not someone whose really into open world style games such as GTA or even western stuff, but this one has a special place in my heart.

At one of the lowest points in my life, and after many years of putting it off, I beat this game in its entirety twice. And i'm not kidding when I say this: this game genuinely changed my life and the way I view the world. Arthur Morgan is hands down one of the most relatable and most well written characters in fiction ever, and I oftentimes forget that he's not a real person in history.

Almost everything about this game, to its story and visuals, are gorgeous and breathtaking. I'm in love with the characters, the stories they tell, and my only wish is that Rockstar would focus on these characters and let us experience what its like to be them rather than milk their decade-old game's online mode. No other game has captivated me as much as this one, not even RDR1 (and I love that game too!) 

Obviously, the game itself is not without flaws (but like, what game isn't?) I'm admittedly not a fan of how the guns work compared to the first game. It feels like the focus was more on realism and that kinda tanked that aspect for me, especially the gun oil mechanic. And my #1 biggest complaint is still John's character model in the Epilogue (seriously, Rockstar??? WHY?) However, i'm willing to look past most of that simply because of just how beautiful the rest of the game is.

I can't believe I put this game off for so long all because I thought it was just gonna be ""GTA with cowboys and horses."" That cannot be further from the truth. That will forever be the biggest mistake I ever made. While I know RDR2 is popular, this is the only game I think deserves its high status. I don't usually say this, but this game is a genuine masterpiece, and it's the one game I think everyone (yes, everyone) should sit down and play though at least once in their life. It really did change my life for the better, as before I played this, I was not a great person admittedly, but this game taught me that to see good in the world, it all starts with you. I never thought a game about outlaw cowboys would be so emotional and make me cry. Arthur showed me what it truly means to live with ""high honor."" If I could give this game one central theme, it's ""be the change you want to see in the world."" 

I could go on and on, but instead of listening to me ramble about it, you should try it for yourself. It usually goes on sale for about $20, so if you can, please, just give this game a full play-through. It's well worth it, heck its even worth the $59.99 in my opinion.",True,Strategy

Red Dead Redemption II is not just a game it’s an experience, a world so immersive and emotionally powerful that no other game has ever made me feel the way this one did emotionally. Set in 1899, at the tail end of the Wild West, it tells a gripping story of outlaws desperately trying to survive as the world around them changes. With god looking visuals, deep storytelling, and unparalleled attention to detail, this game is a masterpiece that defines what gaming as an art form can achieve in every parallel. I can say with confidence that this journey was worth every moment.

Story Mode
The game follows Arthur Morgan, a senior member of the Van der Linde gang, as he struggles with loyalty, morality, and survival in a world that is leaving outlaws behind. The writing is phenomenal, and Arthur’s development is one of the best character arcs in gaming history. His journey is emotional, tragic, and deeply personal, making you feel every triumph and heartbreak along the way, along with every change he makes. The relationships he forms with the gang, especially with Dutch, Hosea, John, and Sadie, feel incredibly well made, and watching the gang slowly unravel makes you feel desperate and sad. Few games have ever made me feel so connected to a character or so invested in their fate.

Open World
The open world of Red Dead Redemption II is unmatched in detail and beauty. From the snowy peaks of Ambarino and its big mountains to the swamps of Lemoyne and Saint Denis, the east country side of the New Hanover and the deserts of New Austin with now Tumbleweed being a real town and Armadillo rolling on the cholera, along with the magnificent West Elizabeth with Strawberry and Blackwater, every location is stunningly crafted and feels alive. The world reacts to you in ways no other game does, NPCs remember you for actions you did previously by helping or vice versa, animals have lifecycles and they can rot all day if you kill them, and random encounters can turn into meaningful little side stories. Riding through the vast landscapes as the sun sets, watching thunderstorms roll over the horizon, or simply camping under the stars makes every moment feel like a living, breathing Western film.

Music and Soundtrack
The soundtrack is pure magic. It captures the essence of the Wild West, with hauntingly beautiful melodies during quiet moments and intense, adrenaline pumping compositions during action scenes. Moments like ""Unshaken"" playing as Arthur returns to camp, or ""That's the Way It Is"" during one of the game’s most emotional scenes, are unforgettable. The music, combined with the atmospheric sounds of nature, bustling towns, and distant gunfire, makes the world feel truly alive.

Gameplay
The gameplay is methodical, immersive, and deeply rewarding. Gunfights are weighty and satisfying, enhanced by the iconic Dead Eye system. Horseback riding is the best in any game, making travel across the vast frontier a joy in itself. Hunting, fishing, and survival mechanics add to the realism, while side activities like poker, bounty hunting, and treasure hunting ensure there’s always something meaningful to do. The sheer depth of interactions, from greeting strangers to robbing them makes every playthrough feel unique.

Achievements
Completing every single achievement was a long but rewarding journey. From finishing the gripping main story and obtain 70 gold medals, to mastering challenges, collecting rare items, and fully exploring the world, each achievement felt like an accomplishment. The journey to 100% completion pushed me to experience every aspect of the game, and every second was worth it even though I've already played it on console.

Conclusion
Red Dead Redemption II is more than a game it’s an emotional journey that no other title has ever made me feel. It’s a story about loyalty, loss, and the end of an era of people who are getting kicked out, this game brought to life an unmatched level of detail and care. The world is stunning, the soundtrack is unforgettable, and Arthur Morgan’s journey is one of the greatest ever told in gaming, one of the greatest characters in video game history. Having completed every achievement, I can confidently say this is one of the best games ever made, and an experience that will stay with me forever in my life.",True,Strategy

Red Dead Redemption 2,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing experience all; stunning visuals, a well written story and a soundtrack that was stuck in my head for weeks even after finishing the game, it really has everything. Red Dead Redemption 2 has so many ways to make the world around you feel alive, amazing map design and visuals really come together to create an open world experience that feels higher quality that most games of the genre even in 2025. The immersion is only improved with random encounters, there is such a long list of random events that can happen - that you might not run into the same event twice in a play through. The character design for all of the gang helps the characters to fit in around the story without dragging it down or sticking out. The is a lot of story characters, and all of them are written exceptionally well, something that is hard to believe when looking at the depth and background of all of the gang. Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an experience everyone should try if they're interested, there's truly nothing like it.",True,Strategy
Red Dead Redemption 2,"The gameplay is great, with the best example of Rockstar’s polish and attention to detail to date. You probably already know what you’re getting into on that front, so I will just add that the immersiveness of all the gameplay elements work well in concert with the story and setting. It’s a full world and a joy to explore.

Even if you know how this story ends, the admittedly long trek there is well worth your time. RDR2 left more profound an impact on me than any game I have played. The game uses time and openness to great effect, placing the player firmly in the muddy boots of Arthur Morgan throughout a dynamic narrative. You can play the game like a thrill ride if you want, but it provides space to think if you are willing to take the time.

This contemplative quality was something new to me in a game. It showed that video games have at least one literary advantage over film: participation in the identity of the character.

Red Dead Redemption 2,"It's a masterpiece.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a perfect example of what dedication, art, innovation and love are capable of doing when creating a game. 

I personally love story games since they give me amazing experiences, and are capable of providing me learnings in life. The story that Red Dead Redemption 2 gives us is definetely one of those to remember forever. 

The immersion this game provides is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Just riding my horse for its vast lands, hearing birds singing, water flowing throught the rivers, and animals running is such a beautiful experience that comes directly to my hearth. The amazing sunsets give me calm and peace, as a unique feeling that not other game has brought to me.

The insane details that this games has always surprise me. I wish many other games put this dedication to small details, which despite seeming unimportant, make the game shine enormously. 

I see Red Dead Redemption 2 not just as a game, but also as a beautiful, immersive, moving and unique experience. I completely recommend it. Play it with peace, give it the time it deserves, and you will not regret spending every single second on this masterpiece!",True,Strategy
Red Dead Redemption 2,"With five years of gaming experience, I’ve finally found the one game I admire the most. Red Dead Redemption 2 is, without a doubt, the best game I’ve ever played. I bought it recently, and every penny spent was worth it. The immersive world, gripping story, and unforgettable characters make it an absolute masterpiece.",True,Strategy
Red Dead Redemption 2,"This game is an achievement that only hundreds of talented people, working years with 100s of millions of dollars worth of budget can produce.

The pacing of the story is all over the place at times. Some times glacial slow and others breakneck fast. There's also one section of the game that, although is a nice change of scenery could be cut out entirely and would only help the story as a whole.

Overall this is not an amazing PC port. There is stuttering, some relativity minor graphics issues, physics issues when playing over 60fps and crashing mid-mission. The crashing can be fixed with swapping the graphics API for Vulkan to DX12 and vice versa and the other issues can be fixed with mods but as these issues have been in the game for so long with no official fix, I don't think it's good enough on the developers part.

It took me several hours to really get into this game but if you're happy with tinkering with settings now and again I would recommend it.",True,Strategy

Unfortunately as amazing as the graphics, the dialogue, the characters, the sounds, the music is it is impossible NOT to constantly be bothered by the shitty gameplay, non-sensical story beats and downright horrible gameplay systems which are just either badly designed or poorly implemented or both. 

Every artist working at R* deserves a standing ovation for their work on this game. Gameplay designers, programmers etc. can all eat dirt for the rest of their lives. This could've been an all-time masterpiece but it is nowhere close to that level.

Every single interactive element in the game is bad while non-interactive parts are all great. The problem is that games are an interactive medium. RDR2 is not a TV show sorry but you cannot give a game with bad gameplay 10 out of 10. I don't care how good everything else is.",True,Strategy

Fallout 4,"Rating: 9/10

Fallout 4 (2015) is a massive open-world RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, set in a post-apocalyptic Boston. With its deep world-building, intense combat, and endless exploration, it offers hundreds of hours of gameplay. However, it’s not without flaws—a weaker RPG system, outdated visuals, and Bethesda’s signature bugs hold it back from perfection.

What Makes It Great?
🌍 Incredible Open World
The Commonwealth Wasteland is one of the most detailed and atmospheric settings in the Fallout series. From the ruins of Boston to mysterious underground vaults, there’s always something to discover.

🔫 Improved Gunplay & Combat
Unlike previous Fallout games, Fallout 4 has a solid shooting system, making combat feel more fluid and engaging. The V.A.T.S. system returns, allowing you to slow down time and target enemies with precision.

🏗️ Settlement Building
A brand-new feature, settlement building lets you create your own bases, defenses, and communities. While it’s optional, it adds a unique survival aspect to the game.

📜 Rich Lore & Side Quests
From the Brotherhood of Steel to the mysterious Institute, Fallout 4 is packed with factions, memorable NPCs, and hidden stories that keep you hooked. The side quests are often just as engaging as the main storyline.

🎨 Highly Moddable
The modding community has turned Fallout 4 into an endless playground. With visual upgrades, new weapons, custom quests, and complete overhauls, modding extends the game’s lifespan indefinitely.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Weaker RPG Elements
Fallout 4 streamlined dialogue choices, meaning your decisions often feel limited compared to Fallout: New Vegas. The lack of a true karma system also reduces role-playing depth.

❌ Outdated Graphics & Animations
Even at release, the game’s character animations and facial expressions felt dated. The world is well-designed, but textures and models show Bethesda’s aging engine.

❌ Typical Bethesda Bugs
From broken quests to physics glitches, Fallout 4 has the usual Bethesda charm (and frustration). While patches and mods fix many issues, it’s something to expect.

❌ Repetitive Radiant Quests
Some quests, like Minutemen settlement defenses, quickly become tedious and repetitive, making them feel like chores instead of meaningful missions.

Conclusion
Fallout 4 is an immersive, content-rich RPG that delivers an incredible open-world experience. It’s not as deep as New Vegas, but its exploration, combat, and modding potential make it one of the most engaging post-apocalyptic adventures out there.

Rating: 9/10 – A must-play for open-world and RPG fans, despite its flaws! ⚡💀",True,Strategy

Fallout 4,"PLAYED ON STEAM DECK
As a huge Fallout fan. I must say this game is good. It runs great and it provides hours of fun. If you like open world games, post apocalyptic setting and 1950s retro futurism, this game is for you!

The only issue is that RPG mechanics were a bit downgraded compared to Fallout 3 and especially Fallout New Vegas but that doesn't mean the game isn't less enjoyable.

Imo its much more fun than Skyrim which is overrated.",True,Strategy
Fallout 4,"It's so good! You can help rebuild society or claim the commonwealth for your faction. Whether you choose to be the hero or a villain, there are so many possibilites! The game has a brighter color pallet and different style compared to the previous  Fallout games. Regardless of appearance, this game delivers what it promises. Fun action packed game play, exploration, crafting, branching story lines, and soooo much more! It also wouldn't be Fallout without the option to travel with a companion and there are a lot of options! I highly recommend this game!",True,Strategy
Fallout 4,"After playing Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and briefly the first 2 official fallouts. To be honest, It's not as good as them. I miss the old skill point system as they just felt better unlike the perks system we have now. Other than that, the story, the graphics, and the overall gameplay is amazing :D",True,Strategy

My main problems with the game are even on survival the game is too easy and there's no real dialogue choice, whatever dialogue option you choose you usually end up with the same result. Still, it's a great game well worth the price.",True,Strategy
Fallout 4,"You can spend over hundred hours on this game and still come across something you wouldn't imagine. I would recommend for those that enjoy being drawn in by the story and want an adventure. 

I would recommend not downloading mods if you want a smooth experience with the game and no sudden unexpected crashes, except if your using the creation club. Speaking from experience, complete the game with no mods then mod till your happy. Ive come across secret achievements that mods have bugged, so im having to rerun the game. So for the moaners, remove your mods, test, then complain :)",True,Strategy

Fallout 4,Fun for the first 30 hours or so when things feel new and fresh. Starts to get a bit too stale for me after that. It didn't has the same draw as Fallout 3 or New Vagus.,False,Strategy
Fallout 4,"Fallout 4, I remember getting this game for Christmas back in 2015. Crazy that it was 10 years ago. I love this game, I know its a bit controversial for a fallout entry, but I know some fan have a bit to say about it. 
Out of the entire fallout franchise I do think this game has the best gun play, but it's not the greatest RPG. I do love exploring the world its massive. Exploring the apocalyptic Boston is extremely entertaining. 
My only beef with the game is I wish it had weapon degrading like in the other fallout, even in survival mode this game doesn't entirely feel like a fallout game. I also hate that the nuka world ending doesn't have a minutemen ending. Like why? They could have added one easy. 
All in all I give the game an 8/10 its just the little things that bug a huge fallout fan like myself.",True,Strategy

Big critiques from me are the legendary enemies. Bullet sponges are not fun, and they have 2 modes: complete pushover and literally God Himself. There is no in between.
I wish there was more big bulky weapons, the Power Armor is the best. Very bulky Power Armor and it really fullfills that ""man wearing a tank as armor"" fantasy but the weapons you have to match are very limited. You get Fatman Launchers, Gausse Rifles and Miniguns, 1 of which is usable, another is absolute dogass and the other is literally just asking to kill yourself.

Back to the game, It feels like a Skyrim total conversion because it is and being a Skyrim fan with waaay to many hours I already felt at home.

I have all the DLC and am kinda glad I do TBH because it seems I needed to level up quite fast before embarking on some treks, yes this can feel like a walking sim to some but I've also put too many hours into Dayz so again I'm still at home.

I love map and how it's laid out Rad storms will catch you out so beware and if your going on a long trek make sure to have radaway and a trusty robot companion that is able to assist with fights (finish automaton DLC)

Settlements, can feel like a management game to many but I will say one thing don't just build a radio mast and genny, put up some defences too and ensure the place has minimum resources otherwise you'll have to keep coming back!!

Some love the weapon building mechanics some hate it (it subtracts from having more variation of weapons).",True,Strategy
Fallout 4,"I gave this game a lot of flak for years. ""Not as good as New Vegas"" and I still hold to that, but it isn't a bad game, just mediocre at what should be the more interesting parts. The set pieces and acting and mechanics are much better in this game, aside from bullet spongy enemies.

The issue comes down to a couple things. The first is that overall the endings aren't any better than New Vegas and they even lack in ways. The fights between the major factions don't feel like it often enough. Not enough build up.

The second is likely the core of the issue. There isn't much of a relation between towns. Got some fluffy back story about how Goodneighbor was formed from the outcasts kicked out of Diamond City, and how Sanctuary was formed from remnants from Quincy, but that is it. The farms and other minor towns don't have any relation to others, and even then, Goodneighbor has a right to be angry, but they don't do anything to ""get even."" The major factions leave each town or city alone. Never see people in Power Armor standing guard in Diamond City or purging Goodneighbor. It is like the developers were too afraid to try to do something more interesting.

In New Vegas, there was the central city of New Vegas, and then it had a slum made the outcasts of the city center. That slum had its own power structure and quests, and that place also had areas that broke off from it (Aerotech and Westside). Then the towns around did things like provide rest spots for tourists or supplied food for New Vegas. Practically every part of the map was connected to the central city and the events surrounding it. It made the story more engaging and interesting. Do you power parts of the Wasteland, or do you get a space laser weapon? Do you kill off some people you can't see and supply clean water to farmers, or let them live and have food production be worse off for everyone in the region? Do you dig into the past of a massacre where the ""good guys"" murdered women and children and tried to cover it up, affecting public opinion? There are a ton of minor factions and they all influence each other based on how the player acts. FO4 has only two interesting minor factions. Everything else is practically a flag on a farm.

Fallout 4 has reached a point in which the mods for it fix a lot of the issues. Some mods add entirely new endings which you can have a giant robot companion or turn the Diamond City into a slaver den. So I can recommend it now as a Pretty Good* game, instead of just mediocre (because of the writing and late game balance).",True,Strategy

When choosing a faction to side with, I wasn't really drawn to anyone. It didn't seem to me that choosing one would make an overall difference in the endgame. Side quests are okay if it's not just running an errand, investigating a dead person's holotape, or defending some random people just because the Minutemen told you to.

It is more of a shooter with slight RPG-elements, when it should be the other way around. It's like they actually developed a shooter in the Fallout-universe and added those RPG-aspects as an afterthought a few weeks before release.

Yet they certainly wanted to hammer in those overcomplicated, finnicky settlement-mechanics, adding nothing but busywork. Could have been a nice addition if there was only one or a few settlements to manage, seeing them prosper, being an established base for the player where the story unfolds, but no. There seem to be 30+ of those settlements. You might get slight advantages building them up but it is nonstop busywork as far as I can see. Only few people seem to really like it. I don't. It' just out of place.

It's a weird mix, weird decisions made in development leading to a very shallow experience so far. I guess I will try to play on to at least finish the story, but I seem to lose all motivation after 30-60 minutes. It's just that boring and uninvolving.

A ""meh"" game overall, a bad Fallout for sure. Glad I only payed 10 bucks for it.

The AI frequently fails to effectively manage traffic congestion, offering only minimal solutions, which can be quite frustrating. Implementing a smarter, more customizable AI system would significantly improve the experience. Another major drawback is the physics engine, which lacks realism and responsiveness and need some mods to fix that.

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"As someone who has spent countless hours exploring its roads, delivering cargo across its expansive map, and enjoying the meditative nature of the gameplay, I can confidently say that ETS2 holds a special place in my heart. However, despite my love for the game, recent developments have introduced issues that are difficult to overlook.

Before delving into the details, I must mention that this is my first-ever review on Steam. I felt compelled to share my thoughts because, while I have thoroughly enjoyed ETS2 over the years, the frustration caused by certain aspects of the game has reached a point where I believe it’s important to speak up.

The most glaring problem lies in the performance drops observed in newer DLC maps. While the visual upgrades and reworks in these areas are undoubtedly impressive, they come at a significant cost to performance. Even on systems that comfortably handle the base game and older expansions, these regions often result in frustratingly inconsistent frame rates. What makes this particularly exasperating is the fact that these issues did not exist before the reworks. The optimization—or lack thereof—seems to be an afterthought, leaving players with an experience that is at best distracting and at worst unplayable.

Adding to the frustration is the artificial intelligence (AI) of the game, which, despite years of development, remains woefully inadequate. The AI-controlled vehicles routinely demonstrate behaviour that ranges from mildly inconvenient to outright absurd. Sudden lane changes without signalling, failure to yield at intersections, and an uncanny ability to brake at the worst possible moment are just a few examples of the nonsensical antics players must contend with. While a degree of unpredictability is realistic in traffic simulations, the AI in ETS2 often feels less like a reflection of reality and more like a caricature of it.

As a devoted player, it is disheartening to see such issues persist in a title that I hold in such high regard. The developers' commitment to expanding the game’s world is commendable, but these efforts must be matched by a focus on optimization and refinement. Without addressing these problems, the experience of exploring ETS2’s beautifully crafted roads will continue to be overshadowed by technical and design shortcomings.

Euro Truck Simulator 2 deserves to shine as the definitive trucking simulator, and I truly want to see it thrive. However, until these frustrations are resolved, even the most loyal fans may find their patience wearing thin.

For a game that I have spent so much time enjoying, writing this review was not an easy decision. Yet, I hope this feedback helps highlight areas for improvement and contributes to making ETS2 the best it can be.",False,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"Way, way more enjoyable than it has any right to be.  Surely just driving goods around Europe (and beyond with mods) or the US (and beyond with mods) with American Truck Simulator cannot be this totally engaging?  Well, yes it certainly can.  It can be as chilled or frantic as you wish.  Personally I'm definitely at the chilled end.  Watch the world roll by, learn to manoeuvre a large truck and trailer.  The new driving helps with that.  Build a trucking empire if you wish, or not.  Pimp out your trucks, or not.  It's all up to you.
There are tons of paid addons and mods to add maps, trucks, trailers, cars, customisable elements for your trucks etc.  Mods allow you to make it harder to make money, or make the weather and road conditions tougher if you want a greater challange.

Do yourself a favour and give it a go, and be surprised at how much fun it is!",True,Strategy

SCS employees are some of the rudest and unprofessional people in this industry, so I'd recommend never making a community post (regardless of how benign you might think it is) because they love the ban hammer way more than they love their game. American Truck Simulator is a little better gameplay-wise, but the community management and developers are the same. I'm permanently banned with a message ""you're right I'm too lazy to go through your posts.""

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"Once a classic, now an embodiment of everything I dislike about current video games.

Current state of ETS2/ATS is frustrating. I just can't enjoy those games anymore. The main gripe I have with ETS2 is the fact that this game is horrendously unoptimised. No matter how good your PC is... FPS drops, stuttering just can't stop. Various changes in commands don't help. Changing video setting doesn't help. Game engine just can't support further graphic enhancements, yet SCS blindly walks in the way of constant graphic addons, while disregarding any optimisations for the game. Of course, they are completely deaf to any feedback in that regard. Of course, any suggestions are immediately being responsed by game ""fans"" (cultists would be more appropriate) who are quickly telling you that you/your computer are the problem, not the game and its aged engine, incapable of being overrun with current amount of details.

Nextly, ETS2 and ATS are being kept alive through constant releases of new DLCs. OK, it's great to have new maps, trucks, skins, but what's that for, if you can't enjoy it as you should?

In my opinion, both ETS2 and ATS have reached their limits. It's time to move on, if SCS wants to continue with their current MO.

To sum up - horribly unoptimised game with plenty of paid DLC... Is that EA or something?

Such a shame, incredibly fun game to play. Sadly, ruined by its shortcomings and failure from developers to be aware about them.",False,Strategy

Pros:
✅ Immersive and Relaxing Gameplay – Drive across Europe, delivering cargo and enjoying the scenic routes. The game offers a realistic and peaceful trucking experience.
✅ Huge Map and Expansions – The base game covers many European countries, and DLCs add even more regions with stunning landscapes and detailed cities.
✅ Deep Customization – Modify your trucks with countless options, from paint jobs to engine upgrades.
✅ Engaging Economy System – Build your own trucking company, hire drivers, and expand your business empire.
✅ Great Modding Community – Tons of user-made content, including new trucks, maps, and improved graphics.
✅ Multiplayer (Convoy Mode) – Play with friends and enjoy cooperative trucking.

Cons:
❌ Slow-Paced for Some Players – If you prefer fast action, this may feel too relaxed.
❌ Repetitive at Times – Long hauls can get monotonous without variety in tasks.
❌ DLC Costs Add Up – While the base game is great, the full experience with all expansions can be expensive.",True,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"“10/10 Would Drive Again (And Again, And Again… And Crash Into My Friends)”

I bought this game thinking I’d just do a few casual deliveries. Turns out, I’ve now spent hours and hours transporting cargo across Europe, listening to podcasts, and becoming emotionally attached to my truck. My truck’s name is Sheila, and she deserves the world.

The beauty of the open road is unparalleled. I’ve gone from dodging traffic to getting lost in small villages, but I’ve also mastered the art of parallel parking (sort of). I can now pull off a perfect turn in a 40-ton vehicle. My real-life driving skills are… well, let’s just say, “evolving.”

Then I discovered TruckersMP, and it was game over. Now I’m not just dodging traffic—I’m dodging my friends, who are just as bad at driving as I am. The multiplayer chaos is like nothing else. I’ve spent hours in convoy, pretending to be a professional driver while simultaneously running my friends off the road. We’ve crashed into each other more times than I’d like to admit, but hey, that’s just the beauty of multiplayer. Who needs peaceful deliveries when you can have reckless, hilarious chaos?

Pro tip: If you crash, don’t worry—just blame the AI drivers. They’re the true enemies. They have a mission to ruin your life, one unnecessary brake at a time.

In short: this game has ruined my life, but in the best way possible. I’m currently considering a career change to trucking. If only my boss would let me take an 18-wheeler to work. But then again, I’d probably crash into my coworkers.",True,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that you dive into headfirst. If you’ve ever dreamed of being a long-haul trucker but weren’t ready for the real-life hassle, this game gives you all the thrills without the stress.

As someone who holds a truck driving license in Israel, I can say this game is a great training tool for anyone wanting to feel the intricacies of handling a large vehicle. It’s not just about driving around Europe, it’s about planning your routes, respecting traffic laws, and understanding the weight of a truck when turning. The sense of realism here is top-notch – from the sound of the engine to the feeling of heaviness on tight turns.

The game is designed in a way that keeps you engaged: from the busy highways filled with traffic to dynamic weather and day-night cycles that add to the immersion. The controls feel natural, and this sensation not only enhances the game but also serves as good practice for real life, since driving a virtual truck can be a useful experience.

Pros:
	•	Realism: You’re not just a driver, you’re a manager. Every detail on the road matters, and it adds a unique charm to the game.
	•	Maps and Locations: Travel across Europe, delivering cargo to beautiful corners of the continent. Each route feels different.
	•	Training for Real Drivers: As someone with a truck license, I can say this game is a solid practice ground for real-life driving. It helps get used to the scale and feel of handling a truck.
	•	Atmosphere: Rain, nighttime driving, long roads—everything pulls you into the life of a trucker.

Cons:
	•	Monotony: Sometimes the trips can feel repetitive, but if you enjoy slow-paced gameplay, it’s not a dealbreaker.
	•	Graphics: While the game looks great for a simulator, you may notice some outdated textures on distant objects.

Final Verdict: 9/10 – Not just a simulator, but a true experience that combines real-life training with an immersive journey across Europe. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to step into the shoes of a trucker and enjoys laid-back but engaging gameplay.",True,Strategy

Euro Truck Simulator 2,"I have only just started playing this game as i'm relatively new to PC gaming. So far this is up there with the best game I have purchased and I already have a lot of games. Surprisingly this is a 10 year old game, I say that because to me it doesn't feel that old as the graphics are amazing on my desktop PC at full performance

My eagerness to build up my money to own my own business and hire my own drivers are pushing me forward in the game, I am also so determined to own my own truck and drive around the map exploring. But I feel this will take some time and will require doing a lot of quick jobs. 

My only annoyance is that all locations are not unlocked such as the dealership locations, it's only a personal preference thing as IRL we just use google or look at market ads. Who drives around trying to find places we don't know exist these days? 

I love the weather effects, I wish there was mist and fog though as I feel that's missing from the game. I love that the rain appears on the windows and washes away with the wipers, take note here Giants (Farming Sim), it's a small thing but it makes such a difference. It's relaxing to play, once you have got the setting adjusted to how you like to play. I removed the road blocks as I got stuck where I could only reverse down a one way road and then the police penalised me. Like what the heck was I to do? 

I am pleased to see the developers expanding this game further and they are clearly a very talented team, but I agree with others that the UK map needs updating urgently. It does feel outdated and I hope is at the top of the to-do list. 

A solid 9/10 for me.",True,Strategy

Space Engineers,"I've been playing this game for years and, though I may take breaks for long periods of time, I always come back and I always love playing.  I admittedly prefer playing with friends, and it's hard for me to truly enjoy this game solo, but that's just my personal preference.

I support their pricing and, even though buying the game with all the DLC is going to net you around $100 US you can still get all of the experience by playing the base game for $20 (even cheaper if you can catch it on sale).  I appreciate that, even though they've released SE 2, they're still developing and supporting SE 1 as of the writing of this review.

If you're thinking you might want to try this, buy the base game on sale, grab a friend or two, and dive it.  I think you'll be pleased with the game overall.",True,Strategy

Space Engineers,"I bought this game when it launched. 
The game still feels incredibly empty.

Its just a ""survival"" sandbox game with nothing to keep you interested. 
the only thing the game has going for it is the building mechanic. there isn't a reason for the survival mechanics other than an occasional distraction when outside a ship seat. you only need O2 and suit energy. 

all the scenarios are half baked spawning you in with no direction. the point of a scenario is to give the player a direction to go on and enjoy the game. this misses the mark by a mile. 
i don't remember any player made scenarios that make you feel like you're playing an actual game. 
and the multiplayer is still bugged and laggy. im on fiber internet and MP still lags.

It may take some people a while to learn with all the available building pieces and moving parts but once you build your first working creation it is all worth it, and it only gets better.

Space Engineers,"Space Engineers – 884 Hours In, Still Addicted

After 884 hours, I can say Space Engineers is hands down one of the best sandbox games out there. If you love building, space, and engineering, this game will hook you.

You can design anything—from small fighters to massive capital ships and full-on planetary bases. The physics make everything feel real, and every ship you build actually has to function, not just look cool. Survival mode keeps things challenging, with resource management, power issues, and random pirate attacks to keep you on your toes especially with mods gosh darn then it gets epic!!!!

The multiplayer is where it really shines. Building with friends, setting up space stations, and getting into full-on wars is insanely fun. Add in the modding community, and you’ll never run out of new things to try.

The graphics are about that of No Mans Sky and the gameplay is similar. Ive been playing for about 3 hours now and thats just getting through the Tutorial and getting into a game. The game crashed once more while i was trying to find a Server to join, but didnt crash after that. It gets a bit laggy when you open the build screen, while it loads all the things you can build so thats kind of a erk lol. Its great to play with friends or just talking with friends on discord and ive yet to game with other people so idk how that would play out on the Steam Deck. I would recommend this however to anyone who likes to discover things and build things. Its definitely a Gather materials and dont let your power or oxygen run out survival type game and that is actually got me interested. I like it and can't wait to get further into gameplay.",True,Strategy
Space Engineers,"Really good game about constructing anything from small rovers for roaming the surface of a planet to massive multiple story ships that can function as a mobile base. You can to make sure all the systems of your ship work properly and are connected to each other while also trying to keep your build looking nice. Personally I play survival because I find the grind for resources makes you build things you wouldn't otherwise in creative however if you're trying to conceptualize a ship you can make it in creative, Blueprint it and then build the blueprint in survival. My (and from what I can most people also have this issue) main gripe with the game is once you're done building what you want to build there's not much to do with your ships. The NPC system is bare bones and is mostly there to gain reputation with nonexistent people, You'll find space pirates or civilian freighters but they're basically just robots. I highly recommend you get your footing with the controls and learn how to add ship systems and then add some mods to make things interesting.

Every time I play this game, I plan, and the amount of time I need to achieve my goals is dictated near exclusively  by how well I plan and how much I am willing to put into it. I cannot tell you how much this game breaks the mold of being trapped in a 'developer alley' where you put time and effort into pointless time sinks of 'game design' to sacrifice the game being fun on the altar of 'balance' whatever that is.

If your game requires me to watch hours of tutorial videos just to literally even do anything, I'm not sorry to say, your game just sucks.

Watch and do tutorials, Its a sandbox, here are tools, enjoy the grind and build stuff.

While some of the systems are explained you really should spend a decent amount of time playing with everything.  This game is definitely more on the technical side and many systems are not communicated properly.

2. Some of the scenarios seem like after thoughts.  You can play in pure space or spawn in planets.  In my personal opinion it does not seem like there is even a base game besides pick something and do something.  I have never been the kind of person that comes in and your handed an empty world and told to do something with it.  I don't find this content type engaging at all.  The worlds are empty and lifeless.  I don't think I actually found any NPC's.

3.  The build system is fairly complex.  Its not something you can glance over and be on your way.  The number of components can be overwhelming.  Even filtering you can choose the wrong thing.  So learning what they call things and being able to filter on them accurately becomes a must.

4.  Vehicle and ship building gets into the weeds.  I don't really play games to become a legit engineer.  I would say manageable building blocks are more my style.  In my opinion there is not balance between ultra high level and deep into the weeds on the building systems.

This game is not for you if you are not really into working on finer details of vehicles.  I won't be purchasing the V2 engine as this isn't my type of game.  Please not all things are talked about plainly.  Some of the packs require the Deluxe version to be fully compatible.  I would start out with the base game.  Put some time into and play several of the scenarios.  Read carefully before purchasing the content packs.  Also be aware that Space Engineers two is out in Alpha.  Most of the newer stuff will be directed towards that.",False,Strategy

Space Engineers," Moja recenzja Space Engineers (602 godziny w grze):
Space Engineers to jedna z najlepszych gier dla fanów budowania, eksploracji kosmosu i inżynierii. Możliwości kreatywne są ogromne, a sandbox daje pełną swobodę.

✅ Zalety:
✔️ Niesamowite możliwości budowania – od małych dronów po ogromne statki i bazy.
✔️ Realistyczna fizyka – grawitacja, masa, siła odrzutu, uszkodzenia.
✔️ Multiplayer – wspólne budowanie i eksploracja z innymi graczami.
✔️ Automatyzacja i skrypty – pozwalają na tworzenie zaawansowanych systemów.

❌ Wady:
❌ Brak natywnej mechaniki suwnic i dźwigów – trzeba kombinować z tłokami i rotorami.
❌ System skryptów mógłby być bardziej przyjazny dla nowych graczy.
❌ Brak widoku z kamer na ekranach LCD – co ogranicza możliwość immersyjnych kokpitów i stacji monitorujących.

🎯 Podsumowanie:
Po 602 godzinach w grze wiem, co działa świetnie, a co wymaga poprawy. To absolutnie fantastyczna gra dla ludzi z wyobraźnią i cierpliwością, ale wymaga znajomości mechanik i eksperymentowania.
Polecam! 🚀",True,Strategy

Deep Rock Galactic,"I love this game to death... or at least I used to...
I know that a lot of the veteran players will disagree with me BUT in my personal opinion... the game needs more content and the perk system + the abyss bar could use an entire overhaul...
But I got the feeling that the DEV team has moved onto other projects (including 2 spin off games which nobody asked for...)
They rather spent their resources on a Kickstarter campaign to sell you a 50 € PLASTIC beer mug (not including delivery prices and taxes).

It is really fun with your friends being able to experience a decent co-op playthrough that you go on for hundreds of hours.",True,Strategy
Deep Rock Galactic,"One of the few live services games that are not abusive on the monetization and content slop out there.
It is a great game to find people too, since the last year I've met people that from time to time invite each other to have a casual fun experience or a sweaty tryhard run to speedrun tasks before hiting the bed.

Overall, the game allows a lot of skill expression and has a huge skill ceiling if you plan to perfect its mechanics and discover new ways to play it, which is my case where I like to experiment and fool around what kind of loadout and gameplay I can came out with, and being supportive for my team.  Even if you only like to shill around, it does it well as a casual shooter since you can adjust how complex the missions can be without big tradeoffs on the progression.

The community is great, being in a lobby of four players cooperating with each other is like a more friendly omegle chat experience, even if you all don't share the same language we share the same foolishness in the game. Being in a server with only four players cooperating with each other offers a more empathetic experience in difference with a public server with sixteen or more players in it. By far, I've played with hundred of players and I've only encountered three toxic players, all of them bit the L by the boys and I.

I said as an omegle chat experience, since one lobby I was in one dude just needed to disconnect to fix a broken pipe that was spreading a lot of water in his house and in another a guy was speaking as the door in their room slammed and they disconnected abruptly, making it unknown what the hell happened. Maybe it is just me and my own luck, who knows? Joining pubs in this game is a gamble on what will happen, and that spices up the experience.

Being said all of this, in the last big update, the developers make possible joining prior seasons to complete them and get cosmetics, is the first time I've heard that happens in modern standards.",True,Strategy

A frank 11/10, and even with more than 300 hours in it there are still items to be unlocked, and things to forge. R+S!",True,Strategy
Deep Rock Galactic,"Great game, if played in the right way.

First, there is a single player mode, that is kind of boring. The game lives from communication with the other players. So I would strongly recommend looking for other players to have fun with.

Second, there are multiple difficulties. I find myself only having fun, if the difficulty is set to a level where it's really hard to win (and more likely to loose). It's entirely possible to play on  a difficulty where it feels like a struggle, but it's not *that* hard. However, in my opinion, you miss the entire fun. If you set the difficulty to a level where you loose most games, you need to strategize and actually work together. You experience being overrun by bugs, you need to sacrifice teammates, and you actually have a real victory if you finally win a level after struggling a couple times. And it might sound weird, but I had the most fun in games that I lost. If you play with the right people, you can just have a great time while landing in a cave full of bugs, and being annihilated within seconds.

All together: It's a great game, and I can very much recommend playing.",True,Strategy

The community is amazing; in 1000 hours of gameplay I have encountered one troll. ONE. Everyone else I've played with have been awesome. And Deep Rock players have developed a trait that very few others gaming commutes have: manners. Some players can will at times ignore you when it comes to starting things but will always help you out during combat. And if you don't want to go at it with others you can run solo, you even get a little robot drone to help you out. Classes all play well together and each feels like it serves its purpose. The game has a lot of content and the devs continue to add more. The cosmetics are all free and can always be obtained, even if you missed the season they are on you can replay it for free whenever you want. The only thing you can buy with real money are optional DLC armor packs which you have pressure to buy (all they do is make you look cool). There are also Overclocks.

There are many reasons to love this game and continue playing it and I highly recommend it. It's even got a great price! 

My only major criticism for this game is with crossplay. How come I can't play with my friend on playstation? Crossplay has been the standard for modern gaming since 2018 or something like that! I think the lack of crossplay is unacceptable and is an understandable deal breaker for most people. My friend group will probably never buy or play this game for that reason alone. I haven't done a ton of research on this topic, but it seems like Ghost Ship Games is not making this a high priority issue (at least publicly, I could be wrong). I really hope they fix this, but it's possible they never will.

If crossplay with other platforms isn't a concern for you, I would highly recommend this game.",True,Strategy
Deep Rock Galactic,"DRG is one of the best cooperative FPS games I've ever played. The variety of mission types is very refreshing, the number of different types of enemy bugs provides variety to the tactics and types of threat you face, and the 4 different classes you can play as are perfectly distinct and allow you to specialise in different ways - there'll be a class for you!
The narrative is cool: you're a dwarf sent into space to mine for minerals on the planet Hoxxes, where native bugs will attack you every step of the way. The subtle yet carefully considered worldbuilding help to make an immersive experience.
The game is also very humorous - many of the dwarf barks (lines) make jaunty quips; you can dance along to a jukebox in the lobby; and there are lots of 'beers' you can buy that have hilarious effects.

Also, I don't have a great internet connection so I mainly play Solo, but that in itself is a blast (Bosco is a real one), but I also get the heavy impression that this game has a great community of players that doesn't seem to be thinning out at all - especially with Rogue Core on the horizon.

The main thing I like is the sandbox level design, letting players approach a mission from any way they see fit; the fully destructible environment allows you to do so much in the way of traversal, and picking where and how to fight enemies.

The guns are also all really fun to use, and have their own unique qualities that shape how you approach each level, thereby making the sandbox more interesting.

The game is kind of an overwhelming experience for a new player, but if you play with a group of friends and familiarize yourself with it, Deep Rock can be an unrivaled experience.

Also mods are really easy to add to the game, and enhance the experience soooooo much.

Deep Rock Galactic,"I thought at first this would be another uninspired startup project by some wannabe indie developer, but boy was I wrong. The gameplay is fun, immersive, challenging (without being total bull) and incredibly replayable, you're rewarded for your time and effort with a huge pool of unlockable upgrades and cosmetics, and the interactions between players, enemies, and the environment are all remarkably balanced. And again, the procedurally generated maps and the wealth of game modes and modifiers and enemies and weapons and upgrades, gives amazing levels of replayability. As long as you don't binge it too hard, you won't be getting bored with this game anytime soon.

A Dwarf may leave Hoxxes for a time but the brotherhood stays with you.

Gameplay: ROCK SOLID! 
The options for difficulty make the game both accessible and challenging. Weapon overclock grind can initially feel frustrating to some, I would recommend a minor change to promotions so that the promoted class gets a specific overclock instead of a completely random one. 
This problem can however be solved by save scumming at the forge which will give a desired overclock after 10-20 minutes of restarting the game.



Community: YOU ROCK! 
Genuinely THE BEST I have ever experienced.

Developers and monetization: YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!
DLC are cosmetic only and aren´t even the majority of cosmetics available in the game. Nor are they the best. Those are unlocked through gameplay. Season pass and events are free for all, always.
No microtransaction, the game is future proof because a player hosts the lobby.

My advice: Get the game on sale (or full price, if you roll like that), and if you like it and got the money, grab some DLC.

Deep Rock Galactic,"This game has a bigger emphasis on exploration in unique procedually generated caves that other coop games do not have. It leaves a lot of new players overwhelmed thus quittingDRG saying ''its not a bad game, ill just play it sometime later'' and then forgetting about it. Its a great game but it requires you to adapt to its unique game mechanics(exploration of caves,customizable loadouts,different quests/hazard levels,class roles such as lighting up the cave as scout etc.) not found in other coop PvE games.

There is a lot of content for this game, 24 unique weapons, 16 grenades, 8 utilities and 160 overclocks(powerfull weapons modifiers), with seasonal events and skins still getting added 7 years after its release. It took me about 300 hours to get all the weapons and overclocks (and i still have some beards to collect).

The weapons aren't very balanced, ghost ship taking a more ''fun first'' approach. Gunner, for example has 'salvo moudule' an overclock which allows the hurricane Guided Rocket System to charge up to 9 rockets and  fire them like a shotgun for no downsides. l repeat ROCKET LAUNCHER SHOTGUN and it does not have a downside for using it.


The community is soo friendly too. l had probably less than 10 toxic interactions in over 350+ hours of coop. Most people are very pacient and forgiving towards ''Greenbeards'' especially if they use text chat. However this mostly applies in western europe when i travelled to eastern europe i did se way more toxicity or ''MuST bE SiLveR oR HiGhER'' so i cannot say that its this friendly everywhere.

Deep Rock Galactic,"ROCK AND STONE!

I purchased this game after seeing some reviews videos
 saying it was fun to play and they were right!

The game-play itself supposed to feel repetitive, but it really doesn't. 
From various missions, maps, characters and weapons -
 it really feels fresh and new every time.

There's a bunch of cosmetics to buy with ingame currency, get from the INCLUDED game pass or find hidden in game - FOR FREE. 
Actually most of the cosmetics are free, 
except for a few you buy as DLC to support the creators.

So many fun moments in the HUB while waiting for the next game! 
We had too much beer, got dizzy and drunk, went on a mission,
still were dizzy and drunk in the mission itself!
Also, a beer that turns the game to a PROP HUNT?? like come on! that's too good to be true.

A bunch of ""late game"" content as well to explore with varied difficulty.

This game got me hooked in it and I'm having a blast! 
Already made 4 of my friends purchase and play it. 
One of them said she hates FPS games but really liked this one!
The only problem we now have is playing together as we are 5 so hopefully there will be added CO-OP for larger groups!

34 hours of gameplay in less then two weeks speaks for itself.

Dying Light,"If you want some Mirrors Edge in your Dead Island, look no further. On a serious note, this is one of the greatest zombie games ever made, even 10 years later it holds up remarkably. My only regret is not completing the campaign sooner having completed the sequel at release in 2022. 

Here's the breakdown of who should dive into Harran and who might want to look elsewhere if you're still on the fence:

[b]Who should play Dying Light:[/b]
[list]
[*]Parkour enthusiasts: If you love the idea of fluid movement and mastering a challenging traversal system, Dying Light's parkour is a major selling point. It's not just a gimmick, it's core to the gameplay and incredibly satisfying to pull off.[*]Zombie fans with a taste for tension: The day/night cycle is a game-changer. If you enjoy the feeling of dread creeping in as the sun sets and the infected become more aggressive, Dying Light delivers that in spades.
[*]Players who like a mix of action and survival: It's not pure survival horror, and it's not just mindless action. Dying Light finds a good balance between scavenging, crafting, combat, and tense escapes.
[*]Those who enjoy open-world exploration: Harran is a big place with lots to discover. If you like exploring and finding hidden secrets, you'll have plenty to do.
[*]Co-op players: Zombie slaying with friends is always a good time, and Dying Light's co-op mode is exceptional between the campaign, challenges, and more. 
[/list]
[b]Who might want to pass on Dying Light:[/b]
[list]
[*]Players who prefer realistic zombie simulations: If you're looking for a game where zombies are slow and easy to dispatch, Dying Light's fast and aggressive infected might not be your cup of tea.
[*]Those who dislike repetition: Mastering the parkour and surviving the night often requires repeating sections. If you get easily frustrated by this, it could be a turn-off.
[*]Players who prioritize story above all else: While the story is decent, it's not the main focus. If you need a strong narrative to stay engaged, you might find it lacking.
[*]Those who are easily scared: The nighttime sequences can be genuinely terrifying. If you're not a fan of jump scares and intense situations, you might find it a bit too much.

Dying Light,"Review: Dying Light 1 has been one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. This game offers a unique combination of action, horror, and parkour skills that keeps you entertained and challenged for hours.

Graphics: The city of Harran is beautifully designed with a lot of details, immersing you in a post-apocalyptic world full of dangers and challenges. The lighting and environmental effects are impressive and effectively convey a scary and tense atmosphere.

Gameplay: The parkour system allows you to move freely within the game environment, escaping from or overcoming zombies. The parkour skills make every moment of the game feel thrilling and full of adrenaline.

Melee combat is also very diverse and engaging. You can use a variety of melee and ranged weapons and also craft different traps and equipment to survive. The variety of enemies is vast, and each type of zombie and dangerous creature attacks you with its own strategies.

Storyline: The storyline is captivating and keeps you engaged until the end of the game. The characters are well-developed, each with their own stories and motivations. The main and side missions are very diverse, each with its own challenges and rewards.

Music and Sound Design: The game's music is very appropriate and in sync with the game's atmosphere, enhancing the feeling of fear and tension. The voice acting of the characters and the zombies is also very realistic and professionally done.

Overall, Dying Light 1 is an unforgettable and exceptional experience that I recommend to every fan of survival horror games. This game combines all the necessary elements for an exciting and adrenaline-packed experience and will keep you entertained for hours.",True,Strategy

Dying Light,"Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"amazing game. good graphics for 2015, good game mechanics and phisics but i play on normal and its quite hard its better to play with more people",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"The phrase ""Simply a masterpiece"" is correct and can be used in written English.
It is often used to describe something extraordinary or exceptionally well-done. For example, ""That painting is simply a masterpiece, it's hard to believe anyone could create something so beautiful.""


Ten years ago, Dying Light emerged as a groundbreaking survival-horror experience, and today, it remains a gold standard in the genre. A seamless blend of heart-pounding parkour, visceral combat, and an immersive open-world design, Techland crafted an experience that transcended the typical zombie game formula—delivering a dynamic, adrenaline-fueled nightmare that still holds up against modern titles.

From the moment you set foot in Harran, Dying Light ensnares you with its breathtaking world-building. The city, a decaying urban labyrinth teeming with the undead, feels alive in its own eerie way—daylight offers a fragile sense of security, while nightfall unleashes horrors that make every rooftop sprint a desperate fight for survival. The game's parkour system was revolutionary upon release, making movement not just a necessity but an art form. Every chase, every escape, every leap across the ruined skyline feels fluid and exhilarating, a true testament to Techland’s mastery of game mechanics.

Combat is a brutal, weighty affair, demanding both strategy and reflexes. Whether you're slicing through hordes with a well-crafted machete or smashing skulls with a makeshift sledgehammer, every hit carries a tangible, bone-crunching impact. And then, of course, there's the night—where Dying Light truly separates itself from the pack. The transition from hunter to hunted, the sheer terror of being pursued by Volatiles, makes for some of the most pulse-pounding moments in gaming history.

Beyond its gameplay, Dying Light has aged like fine wine, thanks to Techland’s unwavering commitment to post-launch support. A decade later, the game boasts new content, enhanced mechanics, and a dedicated player base that keeps Harran’s streets alive. This isn’t just a survival horror game; it’s a testament to what happens when developers pour passion into their work.

In an era where many games fade into obscurity, Dying Light remains, simply, a masterpiece.

Dying Light,"So I used to play this game on Xbox, and thus have probably sunk a lifetime amount of around 250 hours playing this game. Its basically what you'd get if Dead Island and Mirror's Edge had a baby, and it is probably my favorite zombies game ever, just next to COD Zombies. Roger Craig Smith delivers a really amazing performance in this game, and the story has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, but I think those moments are only as impactful because of Roger. The story is, in hindsight, kind of basic. Jade is pretty unlikable, and Rahim was really the only other character I found myself entirely invested in. Rais is cool, but he's pretty two-dimensional. The GRE and Ministry of Defense are a whole other beast and I love all the story beats with them involved. The gameplay is genuinely unmatched, however, and the parkour NEVER gets old. My sole complaint with the parkour is that you cannot wallrun, which was shown in the trailer for the game. The gameplay is honestly super addicting though. Combat feels awesome, parkour feels awesome, and the progression feels really good. The Dark Machete is probably my favorite weapon in this game :) I would highly recommend to all of you reading this that you play this game. It's worth your time.

Dying Light,"I want to like Dying Light, but so much of it just is mechanically poorly designed and unfun to interact with.

Basically, the game wants to be Mirrors Edge of the Dead. You're in a zombie infested city; run around, explore, find weapons, fight enemies, pretty basic. There are four main skill/ skill trees to focus on: Running, Fighting, Surviving, and LEGEND,

Running you level up by running. At the start you can barely run fifteen feet, so you'll basically need to level up as soon as possible so you can actually explore and not get swarmed by zombies. Zombies are scary, the devs want you to run away instead of fighting - weapons have low damage, low durability, and can only be repaired a small amount of times. So level up fighting to fix that - by fighting with all the terrible fighting skills you have. You can barely kill a zombie with and when you try the game just spawns more behind you? Well yeah, you're not supposed to fight. Don't focus on the fighting. 

At least Survivor skills are interesting - new mechanics, like shields, throwables, camo, HP regen to just outside three hit deaths. At higher levels, you get a grappling hook so you can ignore all the running you did first. Also dont die, because then you'll lose the XP you earned.

Is the story good? Pretty much. Is running around fun? Yeah. Is this game explicitly designed for controllers. Oh god yeah. Designed for Co-Op and Dark Souls style invasions? Yeah, and some of it so badly designed its almost impossible to do solo. Don't worry, you can check the wiki pages and see that it recommends you buy the DLC weapon packs for the strongest version of the weapons to help you.

I want to like Dying Light. I really do, but every time I played I just got frustrated with the clunky controls, badly designed enemies, poor quality of life, and repetitive experience. But hey, at least the running is pretty fun when you get it to max level and can now sprint without stopping every 10 feet.",False,Strategy
Dying Light,"The definition of mediocrity and special enemies not having different icons on the mini map is bullshit. Not to mention fitting viral zombies and humans is exceptionally awful and no matter what weapon I use from a random pipe on the ground to a crafted sledge hammer with saw blades it still takes way too long to kill enemies, or the hit detection for headshots is completely mangled.",False,Strategy
Dying Light,"If you like JRPGS then this game is your thing. Every quest outside of the main story, is kind of a needless grind. Please let me explain. There two different types of weapons melee and range. You will find better melee and ranged weapons along the way. Side quests rarely offer stronger weapons or gear to help the player loadout. In my experience playing the game I happened upon stronger weapons outside of the side quests. Furthermore, the side quests rarely add to the main story or even flesh out the world. Side quest simply exist to help the player grind EXP and grow to a higher LVL. being a higher LVL makes the game more fun.

I was excited by the reviews, but after playing the story mode I give it a 6/10. The gameplay loop is great, the movement and the environment is top notch. But to hinder all gameplay to an awful story mode took all my enthusiasm. All I could think when I got to the end credits after a very anticlimactic QTE end fight was ""Finally it is over"". Probably much more endurable with friends. It would be way better with more survival elements and more freedom on your own character. Still for the price I got it on sale I still recommend it. Would not replay the story though, just the parkour zombie gameplay.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"Man, where to begin. I first came across this game thanks to a Vanoss video when it was first released a decade ago. I was 15 at the time and had saved up enough to buy the original Xbox One. I was a big BF/COD fan but obviously during that time both series were going through some serious stagnation (Ironic given the current state of both series). So Dying Light was the first game I got for it and I was hooked. The story, pacing atmosphere, weapons, all the different tools, mechanics and everything in between was just *chef's kiss* a masterpiece. The graphics looked incredible on the Xbox One and still hold up today on PC. Co-op with my buddies only magnified the experience and made the game even more replayable no matter how many times I nailed Rais with the knife in the final showdown. Fast forward a year and The Following drops. I wasn't allowed to have a TV, let alone an Xbox in my room at all growing up. My mom was definitely one of those ""video games will rot your brain"" parents but she was understanding enough to let me save up for my own Xbox. The weekend The Following dropped she was out of town for work, while my dad was re doing the floors of the kitchen and living room. So a bunch of furniture and stuff was piled in my room, including the TV we had in the living room. My dad didn't mind me playing video games as long as I wasn't loud. So after helping him tear up the old floor for a couple of hours after school, I hopped on with my buddies and played The Following all night long. IMO The Following was a perfect follow-up. The dune buggies, the countryside setting, new quests and the mystique surrounding the cult was just incredible. This game will always hold a special place in my heart and I always find myself coming back to play the game time and time again. I know a good chunk of the fanbase feels a certain type of way about Dying Light 2. Personally I think Techland tried to catch lightning in a bottle twice and just fell short. However I will always give credit to Techland for being one of the few developers nowadays that actually listens to the fanbase. I really hope The Beast will be as good as the original two games and does a proper service to the Kyle Crane storyline and I think Techland is well aware of the high expectations of the fanbase. I really can't stress enough how much I love this game and can't recommend it enough even a decade after it's release.

Dying Light,"'Dying Light' is an open-world Eurojank zombie game that's so chaotically stuffed with content it's often difficult to make priorities and keep track of progress.  There's so much going on here it's possible to sink 15-30 hours completing the story without even experiencing a solid chunk of the side content.  It's all a bit overwhelming at first and the sprawling, infested map does a wonderful job keeping you feeling small and outnumbered.  As you get the hang of the systems and controls, this hostile environment begins to feel quite exciting.  By the time you've made some significant progress, that world that initially felt impossibly hostile now serves to thrill and empower you.  

I didn't work too hard completing most of the side activities, jumping in spontaneously if I happened across one on the map but never making a point to track them down with completionist intent.  This game is a fun diversion but its visual design and thematic presentation fall short of compelling me to spend time with it after the credits have rolled.  I spent most of my time in co-op, playing with a friend, and doubt I would have finished the game otherwise.  The story is serviceable but it's simply train-tracks to keep you moving through the world in an exciting fashion.  It's the emergent encounters occurring between you and your friends—against the zombie horde—that keep things interesting.  

Everything that's good about this game comes at the cost of being overdeveloped, leading to a feeling of bloat that's intimidating to approach and clunky even when you're used to it.  There's a type of person who will absolutely adore all of this random content but for me it just feels messy and uninspired.  While I had fun strengthening my bonds with my friends I doubt I'll ever be playing 'Dying Light' again.  Perhaps I'll pick up the sequel when I can get all of the content for >$20 (as I did for this one).

In the beggining i was thinking it will be a lame game, when i first got chased in the nights my anxiety rose for a moment, the pursuit in the night are kinda a thing for this game. I played multiplayer only for a bit, because i didn't have the experience of it i got nailed without knowing what i was doing. I think it has good elements, i would reccomend it, i am not sure of the activity of the community though, didnt search it a lot. What i didn't like was sometimes the repetetive actions in the story, like going back and forth whole ways instead of just fast travelling? trascedence via other way?

Dying Light,"It’s hard to believe that Dying Light has been around for 10 years now, but its blend of parkour action, eerie survival horror, and a robust RPG leveling system remains as compelling as ever. Developed by the same team behind Dead Island, the game offers a familiar framework with an exciting twist. While its RPG and leveling mechanics echo the style of its predecessor Dead Island, Dying Light takes the tension up a notch.

For me, the most unforgettable element has been the way the game uses sound to build atmosphere. The growls and screams of the infected send shivers down your spine, fueling that adrenaline rush every time you’re on the run. Even after just four hours of play, I found myself hooked, caught in the thrilling cycle of fear and exhilaration—though I’m still at a lower level and often find myself struggling to fend off the horde.

While I haven’t yet experienced the game with friends, the potential for a shared, chaotic adventure is undeniable. If you’re new to Dying Light, I highly recommend connecting your account to unlock extra goodies and enhance your overall experience. In a nutshell, whether you’re revisiting it after years or playing for the first time, Dying Light is a timeless thrill that proves some classics never fade.",True,Strategy

Dying Light,"💥 Dying Light: The Ultimate Parkour-Fueled Zombie Apocalypse Experience! 💥

Dying Light and its expansions deliver an adrenaline-pumping mix of open-world exploration, brutal melee combat, and heart-racing parkour mechanics that redefine the zombie survival genre. From the sunlit rooftops of Harran to the eerie countryside in The Following, every moment is a test of skill, reflexes, and resourcefulness.

Core Gameplay & Atmosphere
The game thrusts you into a vast, infected city teeming with danger. By day, scavenging and crafting are your best allies as you leap across rooftops, avoiding the undead hordes below. But when night falls, the true terror begins—agile, lethal Volatiles emerge, turning the hunter into the hunted.

Dying Light's fluid movement system makes escaping the infected feel exhilarating, while the brutal combat ensures every encounter is intense. Weapons degrade over time, forcing you to improvise and adapt, whether with a reinforced baseball bat or a shocking katana.

The Following DLC – Expanding the Nightmare
This expansion takes the terror beyond the city, offering a vast countryside to explore—this time with customizable buggies that make mowing down zombies even more satisfying. The cult-like mystery surrounding the new infected keeps you guessing, while the multiple endings add replayability.

Key Highlights:
✅ Parkour-Focused Gameplay: Leap, climb, and vault across rooftops in one of the most fluid movement systems in gaming.
✅ Terrifying Day/Night Cycle: A perfect balance of risk vs. reward—stay out too long, and you’ll regret it.
✅ Brutal Melee Combat: Satisfying, weighty, and strategic weapon-based combat keeps every fight engaging.
✅ Expansive Open World: From urban decay to vast farmlands, exploration is both rewarding and dangerous.
✅ Engaging Co-op: Survive with friends, race to supply drops, or cause chaos together.

Pros:
✔️ Immersive world with dynamic weather and a haunting soundtrack.
✔️ Engaging story with strong side missions and lore.
✔️ Deep skill progression system that rewards different playstyles.
✔️ Tons of content, especially with The Following expansion and community events.

Cons:
❌ Night sequences can feel punishing for casual players.
❌ Some missions become repetitive over time.
❌ Driving mechanics in The Following could be smoother.

🎮 Final Verdict: If you love survival horror, intense action, and freedom of movement, Dying Light is an absolute must-play. Whether you’re scaling a crumbling tower, drop-kicking zombies off a ledge, or racing against time at night, this game delivers an unforgettable, heart-pounding experience.

ELDEN RING,"[h3][i]ELDEN RING[/i] | Perfect Game Review [/h3] 
(100% Completion at 65.3 Hours)
[hr][/hr]
I went into [i]Elden Ring[/i] thinking it was just [i]Dark Souls[/i] on a horse. Instead, I experienced epic battles in breathtaking open worlds, my friend screaming every time we got invaded, and dying to gravity more than any actual enemy (I hate parkour).

I have a confession to make: I’ve never really played a [i]Dark Souls[/i] game, but having completed [i]Sekiro[/i], [i]Remnant[/i], and [i]Hollow Knight[/i], I still consider myself a souls-like gamer. So when my friend mentioned seamless co-op was possible in [i]Elden Ring[/i] thanks to a popular mod, I jumped in and experienced a masterpiece.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Whether you’re dodging tough bosses like a pro, getting knocked off your horse by a random minion, or spending hours customising your character’s face just for it to be hidden under a hideous headpiece (totally me), the possibilities are endless in this wonderfully crafted open world adventure ★★★★★

[b]Graphics:[/b] The world of [i]Elden Ring[/i] is absolutely breathtaking… but if you pause to admire the view, don’t be surprised if you get obliterated by a catapult or drop kicked into oblivion by a giant bird ★★★★★

[b]Sound:[/b] From beautiful melodies to thunderous battle themes, the orchestral score perfectly captures the world’s grandeur. Every swing, spell, and footstep adds to the immersion, making the Lands Between feel truly alive ★★★★★

[b]Story:[/b] The side stories and world-building can be captivating, and I enjoyed interacting with the game’s many fascinating characters. However, the main plot can feel vague and underwhelming at times. And unless you have a PhD in [i]Elden Ring[/i] lore, expect to piece things together slowly through item descriptions and cryptic NPC dialogue ★★★★☆

[b]Replayability:[/b] With multiple possible endings, new game plus, dozens of secrets, hundreds of bosses, and insane build variety, there’s plenty to explore in the Lands Between. And then just when you think you’ve seen it all, [i]Elden Ring[/i] whispers, “Have you tried dual-wielding great hammers?” ★★★★★

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] Like any souls-like game, expect to rage nonstop. The difference? This time, you get to decide whether to die miserably on foot, on horseback, or with your equally doomed friend by your side. Would I recommend [i]Elden Ring[/i]? Only if you're ready for a stunning but punishing adventure—and the chance to put a ring on a lunar princess, even if she immediately ghosts you.

[h3]Overall Rating: 10/10, would set a massive tree on fire and seize the throne again.[/h3]",True,Strategy
ELDEN RING,"Elden Ring is the first FromSoftware game that i actually played and i enjoyed it a lot but its not a perfect game by any means, I would rate it a strong 8 out of 10. There are a lot of things the game does right and well but it has its short comings too

Pros;
Really good boss designs
Art style of the game fits it very well and looks really good
A lot of different viable builds and playstyles
A Big map thats actually filled with content and is not empty
There are some really good quest lines if you follow and pay attention to them
Progression system most of the time feels rewarding

Cons;
Game repeats itself too much, you fight the same bosses over and over again, dungeon layouts are almost identical with only difference being their gimmick or the enemies inside of it
There are a lot of weapons and spells in the game but a lot of them are not viable at all or different versions of the same thing
Game practically forces you to play it at new game+ and finish it again if you want to get your hands on all the weapons and drops etc.. for collection purposes or to try them out. you can't get everything in a single playthrough
Performance is not good, idk how they locked the game to 60 fps on all systems and still did this poor of an optimization job
Keyboard and mouse controls for the game is outright criminal, game tells you to not even bother and go buy a controller. i played through and finished the game with K&M and it was annoying
Camera controls for certain fights and enemies are horrible
Side quests are really really easy to miss out and they have some absurd lock outs, ""oh you dared to explore in this open world game and found a boss we didn't wanted you to fight yet ? 1/3 of the quests are no longer completable""
Game has a decent story but you need to go out of your way to find it, game gives you small pieces of information and expects you to piece it together if you care about lore, if not just go ""unga bunga me find boss me kill boss"" and you'll be fine
Coop system is better than what it was before compared to other fromsoftware games but its still not good, its still a pain if you want to play through the game with your friends and you constantly have to summon each other back into the world and there are some areas you can't even summon and have to play solo, this is not brought up a lot as a negative because fromsoftware fanboys have no friends


Overall i don't want the size of the cons list to make it feel like i hated the game or didn't enjoyed it or something, Elden ring by all metrics a really good game and i enjoyed it a lot, i kept the pros list short because it does those pros really really well",True,Strategy
ELDEN RING,"Elden Ring is not merely a video game, but a transcendental experience—a masterwork woven with the threads of legend, artistry, and meticulous craftsmanship. From the moment one steps into the Lands Between, it becomes clear that this is a world of staggering depth and beauty, one that beckons players not merely to explore, but to immerse themselves in its very soul.

At the heart of Elden Ring lies a narrative that is both haunting and elusive, painted in the broad strokes of myth yet rich with subtle intricacies. The collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin has birthed a world filled with lore that never overpowers, but instead entices curiosity. The story unfolds not through overt exposition, but through atmospheric hints and environmental storytelling, compelling players to unearth secrets on their own. It is a tapestry of broken kingdoms, forgotten deities, and cosmic forces, where each discovery—whether in the form of a cryptic message, an abandoned structure, or a fleeting encounter—feels like a revelation.

The artistry in Elden Ring is breathtaking. From the serene grace of the golden trees in the liminal dusk to the oppressive, yawning voids of desolate catacombs, the game paints its landscapes with a brush that is both grand and intimate. Each area, no matter how bleak, feels alive—teeming with possibility, steeped in history, and imbued with a melancholic beauty that mirrors the world’s fall from grace. It is a visual feast, where even the most innocuous detail—the curvature of a shadow, the scattering of fallen petals—carries the weight of meaning.

The gameplay itself is an evolution of the meticulous design that FromSoftware has become synonymous with, refined and expanded into an open world that feels boundless yet intimately connected. Every encounter, whether against a towering boss or a subtle ambush in a field of flowers, is a testament to the precision of its mechanics. The difficulty, while legendary, is never unfair; it is an invitation to grow, to learn, to rise above adversity through patience, strategy, and resilience. And through it all, there is a profound sense of agency. The world does not hand you your path—it challenges you to carve your own.

Perhaps most remarkable of all is the game’s ability to evoke a feeling of quiet reverence. Elden Ring is not a game that rushes; it exists in its own deliberate pace. The slow, rhythmic exploration of its vast expanses—interrupted by fleeting moments of terror, triumph, and wonder—gives rise to a sense of time itself being altered. In a world that often demands constant motion, this game asks players to stop, to look, to feel.

In conclusion, Elden Ring stands as an unparalleled work of art. It is a testament to the enduring power of the medium, proving that video games are not mere diversions, but can be profound expressions of creativity, vision, and emotion. It is a world to be revered, a journey to be savored, and an experience that will linger long after its final chapter is written. To play it is to witness not just a game, but the unfolding of a masterpiece.",True,Strategy

The gameplay mechanics are smooth and challenging, with each new enemy and level requiring unique strategies and skills. The character progression system also allows players to customize their playstyle and have a unique experience.

The game's story, penned by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin, is complex and captivating, with each new discovery adding more layers to it. The freedom of choice in deciding your path and making decisions adds depth to the game experience.

This is undoubtedly the pinnacle of From Software's work, cutting edge gaming, the tippy top of RPG type gameplay, the most refined formula the souls genre has ever been, -and it is [b]NOT close![/b]

This is basically the game of games for fantasy RPGs. I struggle to think of another game so mesmerizing and mysterious in it's approach, so impressive in it's scenery & setting, so deep in combat mechanics, but so simple of a concept, that it can almost appeal to pretty much anybody from a casual to a min/max tryhard player in every sense of the imagination. 

[h3]This Game Takes You On An Unforgettable Ride[/h3]
You can think of this as a Lord Of The Rings novel made into a game. It is that big and it is actually living up to that kind of an expectation. The hype seems too big, but it will most certainly surprise you with the lengths that they went to. It's a [b]behemoth[/b] of a game and I still am in awe of it after all this time. When you consider that a group of people have made this... sitting in front of a computer for years, tweaking things, writing code, imagining things from scratch. Somebody dreamt this up out of nothing and put all of their soul into it to make it a reality. It is a miracle created from human consciousness. We are so lucky to have it, to get to experience it and for it to be this satisfying.

The fantastical scenery and soundtrack have stayed with me, crossing my mind every now and then, because of how immersive it all is. A combination so ethereal and awe-inspiring, that it makes Hollywood Blockbusters pale in comparison.

Overusing certain assets, copy & pasting a few side bosses in the dungeons, vast areas where you might expect to find more and sometimes don't get rewarded after walking to the end of it. Many people have called these things lazy development and I'd agree with that. Everybody perceives it differently, but I'd say 10-15% of the game is done like that.
The company has only so much time and money they can keep investing before something needs to come out and make money, so considering how insanely polished this game is in all the other areas, I can't dare to imagine what this would have become, had they given it another year of polishing it. Saturating a few areas a bit more with some small rewards, more mobs or dungeons, maybe more quests. Who knows. But the fact that this is the only legitimate criticism that I think is valid, sort of proves that they could have done it even better. The rest of the game is filled to the brim and decked out with a variety of bosses and mobs, environments, equipment and everything that seems so new, fresh and innovative. They stole only from themselves to make up on time and meet the deadline.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
If you don't like this game at all, the chance of it being you and not the game is most certainly over 90%. Maybe even higher. I might be exaggerating, but if you can't see the immaculate beauty in this game, then we are just not living in the same world, I guess. I can hardly contain my love and passion for it. 

This game is the result of what happens when an exceptionally talented group of people actually get close to perfection.

ELDEN RING,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece

FromSoftware has done it again! Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece that blends the best elements of their previous titles with a vast, breathtaking open world. The sense of exploration is unparalleled—every corner of the Lands Between is filled with mystery, danger, and rewarding discoveries.

The combat is as challenging and satisfying as ever, offering a deep level of customization with various weapons, spells, and builds to experiment with. Boss fights are intense and memorable, each designed with incredible attention to detail.

The lore, crafted by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin, is rich and immersive, giving players endless theories to uncover. The world feels alive, yet hauntingly desolate, making every journey feel like an epic adventure.

Whether you're a veteran Souls player or new to the genre, Elden Ring is an experience like no other. It’s punishing, but fair—every defeat is a lesson, and every victory feels earned. If you love challenging gameplay, deep lore, and an open world that rewards curiosity, this game is a must-play.

What I Loved 

Elden Ring looks incredible and is filled with a great amount of beautiful concepts. There are spiritual battle flags standing where massive battles once took place, mmm spiritual trees, spiritual spirits — you get it. The world of this game, despite sometimes feeling still and empty in certain aspects, gives you chills and makes you want to explore.

There are a few exploration caps that require fighting mighty foes to progress, and here lies the cornerstone of this game. Bosses are everywhere, and many of them are the same ones, just appearing in different locations or in a combination with others. They will make you die over and over again until you memorize their movesets and manage your timings almost perfectly. Unfortunately, in many cases, you'll feel happier that it's over rather than proud of your achievement.

Thankfully, Elden Ring offers ways to make things easier. You can explore its world to find better weapons and buffs or obtain summons — some of which can be received within the first 20 minutes of the game. You’ll still need to grind to stand a chance against certain bosses because, without good HP stats, you’ll be constantly one-shotted. If your strength and stamina are too low, you won’t be able to land effective hits in time to defeat a boss within a reasonable time. Eventually, you’ll find good farming spots, and I strongly recommend watching guides to locate them — especially if grinding bores you in other games. Otherwise, you risk burning out before experiencing some of the best and most entertaining parts of this world.

If you, like me, are new to this genre, you most likely will experience something incredible: a shift in mindset that will affect how you approach other games as well. Dying is the core of this game, and although it's sometimes incredibly frustrating, you will eventually learn to lower your expectations before each fight and accept death as a necessary part of the experience. In return, this will make you feel stronger — not because of your character's stats, but because of how much you’ve improved as a player. Your reaction time, adaptability, and skill in general will constantly increase, allowing you to perform well even if you start the game over.

What I Hated

As I mentioned, many bosses require a great amount of attempts to defeat, and some don’t have save points nearby. This means you’ll often have to run back through difficult areas, losing not only time but also valuable HP flasks. It’s time-consuming and frustrating.

Another complaint of mine is that the game barely teaches you anything. I read everything I could and explored every corner, yet after 70 hours, I still found myself confused about the story and how to progress through it. Many times, I stumbled upon the right location or NPC purely by accident. Some say that Elden Ring doesn’t hold your hand so you can experience it on your own, but I’d argue that it’s hard to be invested in the story when, by the time you reach the end, you barely remember where it all started. Many quests are easy to complete unintentionally, and there’s no quest journal - only a few of them even have map markers. There are some general routes to follow, but that doesn’t guarantee you won’t struggle with understanding what to do. I certainly did.

Because of this, while other games often make exploration feel unnecessary by giving you all the information right away, Elden Ring goes to the opposite extreme, offering almost no guidance. This leads to a lack of investment in both the side and main stories.

Final Thoughts

I love and hate this game. It sometimes throws frustrating design choices at you, but it also offers a unique experience — a hostile unforgiving sandbox where you often decide whether to fight or run away. While dying is the core Elden Ring, exploration is also its essence. I don’t think it’s the best game ever, as some claim — there are many flaws — but there is beauty in suffering, in learning through trial and error, and in in eventually overcoming your struggles.

I highly recommend at least trying this game, even if you’ve never played anything like it before. It will likely change how you perceive failing — not just in gaming, but maybe even in life.",True,Strategy
ELDEN RING,"Actually my first Fromsoft, or even soulslike title. Came from growing up with DOOM, Quake, Ratchet and Clank, etc, but eventually just phased out of enjoying games in my early 20s. Picked up this game after hearing about the difficulty on the ps4, and absolutely fell in love, just like I did when I was younger. It's a challenging, but fair, and Fromsoft makes beautiful, detailed games you can immerse in for months honestly. Most of the player base, minus that one group we all know, is super helpful, and kind as hell from my experience. Been my ps4, and steam accounts, I have at least 500 or so hours combined. I even went on to get a nice amount of love, and time in DS1, DS3, and Bloodborne. If you love a challenge, this game is perfect, along with all other Fromsoft titles. Just get used to watching everyone you protect die regardless lol.",True,Strategy
ELDEN RING,"Love this game one of the best souls games out there, with multiplayer that you can play with the bros and create a really awesome journey that will be remembered forever 100/10",True,Strategy
ELDEN RING,Without a doubt my number 1 favorite souls-borne game. The world building was impeccable as with any other souls-borne game but Elden ring has the addition of being absolutely gorgeous.

ELDEN RING,"A nearly perfect game in many ways, and a world you will never forget. Ride through misty forests and dank swamps, explore castles and ancient ruins, and face foes out of your worst nightmares. The lore and story of this world are not spoon-fed to you, and it can be esoteric and strange at first glance, but it will open itself to any player who is willing to look for the details. Once you invest yourself into this experience, it will take over your gaming life for a very very long time.

The challenge in this game is top notch, and will test your abilities in many ways. Most encounters can be changed to make them more or less challenging, depending on how much you want to push yourself. Hundreds of different weapons and dozens of movesets are available, from small daggers to huge warhammers and everything in between (you can even do a hand-to-hand martial arts combat style if you'd like, with the DLC). And for those who appreciate armor and ""fashion-souls"", there are an overwhelming number of armor sets you can mix and match to customize your looks and stats.   

The multiplayer experience takes a few different forms ... you can join friends to go on quests together, invade other players to challenge and ambush them, or go to specialized arenas to match up in fights and tournaments. Some of the match-making for online play can be a little janky from time to time, but overall it's accessible for pretty much every play style.

And he wasn't joking. I'm getting lost while exploring, sidetracked with every new hallway, and distracted my every new group of enemies I stumble across. I can't believe how much of this game while still feeling like I haven't even scratched the surface! There is so. Much. STUFF. Everywhere you go there is someone to fight or something to look at. There're items I know I'll be sinking multiple extra playthroughs into just to get to use them to their fullest and at almost 200 hours, I'm STILL finding new things to craft.

I do wish the experience was a little smoother. There are a few hitches here and there in high intensity areas, but nothing really awful. Taking tight corners causes the camera to jank out like you wouldn't believe and I've fallen to my death from this on Ranni's Rise more times than I can remember. And for crying out loud, why isn't fall damage consistent?! Jumping six stories in one spot and I'm right as rain, but jump from two somewhere else and my ankles are obliterated!

ELDEN RING,"As a lover of FromSoft's pvp since DS1, when I say this is my least favorite FromSoft game, that still makes this one of my favorite games of all time. The netcode has had some improvements and also taken some hits since launch, e.g. backstabs now work, but lag has gotten worse across the board. And the overall pvp balance has improved significantly in the mid to late game while the early game also seems to have gotten worse. If this is your first souls and/or FromSoft title, I strongly recommend getting through at least the first two or three areas without summoning for a better online experience overall, and just avoid the arenas altogether. The one area I think this game shines above the other FromSoft titles is the lore and story. There's just so much of it and it's so well done, so many little plot points and stories all webbed together to untangle like an anthropologist which is an absolute delight to engage with. Fuck the Consecrated Snowfield though. Considering this game is a bit bloated, as open world games often are, I'd just delete that whole area, instantly improve the experience.",True,Strategy
ELDEN RING,"This is an amazing game. I'm only getting started with nine hours in. There are so many interesting things in Elden Ring's vast open world and so many fun opportunities to develop your character. Sometimes combat feels infuriating but there's no better feeling when you beat a tough enemy after so many failed attempts. The game isn't perfect though. Performance issues are one thing. The game freezes often for about 3 seconds not to mention the 60 fps hard limit. My computer has the horse power to run the game at higher fps but that option isn't enabled. For someone like me, who's never played a souls-like game before the does at times feel overwhelming. There are a ton of things players need to learn and the game explains almost nothing about how to play the game and succeed.

ELDEN RING,"overall solid, but not a masterpiece, and lacks the replayability of the other games in the series due it major bloat. i'm a long time souls fan and this ranks in the lower end of the list for me. bloodborne and DS3 are my favorites
it's games like this where i wish there was a ""mixed"" review option

i beat the main game and will update later when i finish the DLC
pros
- in some ways, this game feels like what Dark Souls 2 was intended to be, with a more open, ""alive"" feeling world, not to mention the little touches like the [spoiler] half assed [/spoiler] return of power stancing, key gates, giants, and unfortunately gank bosses
- the ""legacy dungeons"" are overall very well designed. the first one [spoiler] Stormveill [/spoiler] is the fan favorite though, so you could argue the quality drops off gradually. i personally liked [spoiler] Leydell [/spoiler] the most
- combat is more or less dark souls 3 but more fun, they added a new ""guard counter"" which functions like a parry but is easier to use. if you land a certain number, you can stagger the enemy or boss! weapon arts also make a return called ashes of war, which are significantly more customizable. 
- wielding two weapons at once, especially greatswords, can be a lot of fun as well. it isn't like dark souls 2 though, they can only be weapons of the same class
- respecing your character is available relatively early in the gamed
- same engine as dark souls 3/bloodborne/sekiro and it's a PS4 game at base, so graphically you know what you're getting. only new change is the addition of ray-tracing on PC. i personally like the engine and all the plasticy looking characters
- in some ways, this is the most accessible Soulsborne game. you have a new feature called ""spirit ashes"" which are like summons except they are enemies that fight for you. as the game is more open, you also aren't hitting a roadblock too often, and it can be possible to show up overleveled. FromSoft also included a few very explicit farming spots to help make leveling up quicker and earing cash to buy new weapons. [spoiler] the mohg palace cliffside at the start of the area nets you 30-40k souls just be genociding some grey alien looking commoners. it only takes a minute or 2 each run, which then becomes 15 seconds per run once you can get the sacred relic sword and spam waves of gold[/spoiler]

cons
- biggest issue is the bloat. it took me 70ish hours to beat the main game, but realistically there's only 30-40 hours of true meaty content in here, including a bunch of catacombs/caves. there's far too much traversal, and so far this issue has only been exacerbated in the DLC. the first area of elden ring you start in is the largest and most dense, then it falls off the further you get. if someone were to ever make a linearity mod that made the game closer to dark souls 3 or bloodborne in structure, that would be super cool
- a lot of side content is in caves and catacombs, which can be repetitive. i loved the chalice dungeons in bloodborne, but wasn't a big fan of the catacombs, which were similar but lower quality. i did like the miners caves the most, which are more or less required if you want to be able to purchase unlimited weapon upgrade materials. the miners caves reminded me of the one in demon souls
- of all the soulsborne games, i would say Elden Ring by far has the weakest bosses. you definitely have a quantity over quality approach...but this unfortunately extends to the main game as well. there are several main bosses that are outright repeated [spoiler] you fight margit twice, mohg twice, godrick twice, several tree sentinels, the fat noble twice, radahn in the dlc [/spoiler]. there are also a lot of gank fights. all in all, even dark souls 2 wasn't this egregious with boss repetition
- bosses tend to be on the more frustrating than fun side, many of them have aggressive AOE attacks that are difficult to avoid and instant kill, or cause serious issues with the camera like [spoiler] Maliketh, and some of the DLC bosses like dancing lion [/spoiler]. my favorite boss was the final boss [spoiler] Radagon, however the second phase is Elden Beast which is iffy. too much chasing the boss down [/spoiler]
- dark souls 1 had an annoying weapon upgrade system, but there was viability to use different elements. in elden ring, most enemies and bosses are weak to bleed, so you hardly have a reason to use anything else
- [spoiler] malenia [/spoiler] is the hardest and most broken boss i have ever fought in a soulsborne game. after overleveling and using bleed build, i am embarassed to admit i had to use a mimic tear summon. best i could do solo was half of her phase 2 health bar. she breaks all the rules of the game, her most egreious being her life regain that heals her even if she only makes contact with your shield. as a longtime souls fan who fully beat every boss in demon souls, dark souls 1, 3 and bloodborne (missed a couple in 2 and sekiro but i still beat bosses like fume knight and ishin) and recently finished lies of P, i have never used a summon until now
- elden ring has some of the hardest bosses as well. i think a newcomer would truly struggle with even the first two story bosses, with their delayed attacks and 5-7 hit combos
- horse combat is pretty limited. the double jump is nice to have, but your horse can't have
- pc performance has a lot of stuttering issues, and performance is worse in the DLC
- like any souls game, you need a guide for the NPC quests, they're just as vague as before. this is one thing Lies of P did a much better job. it's even worse this time around because the game is so dang open, so you realy don't know where to go and it takes even longer to find NPCs. i missed the most important side quest in the entire game.
- because the game is not linear, there are possibilities you might miss important mechanics. i did not know about the crystal tear system until the [spoiler] Mohg [/spoiler] fight, and then it turned out i never found the item in the game, had to use a guide to locate it
- i solely play PVE so i cannot comment, but i've heard this game has some of the worse PVP in the series",True,Strategy

CODE VEIN,"I liked this game despite some of the design choices.

Boss fights were hit or miss. Some were epic and fun, but others were frustrating because it was hard to see where the bosses' moves would land. Some bosses might have been unnecessarily difficult for me because I didn’t bring a companion to the fights.

Soloing all bosses is definitely doable, though I don't think the game is designed to be played that way. Having a companion makes boss fights much easier, as they can revive you if you take too much damage. Most bosses can kill you in one shot if you don’t block or dodge their attacks.

The music was enjoyable and, at times, even quite epic.

The gameplay is reminiscent of Dark Souls 1 in its clunkiness. Compared to the more modern gameplay of Dark Souls 3 or Elden Ring, it’s definitely less refined, but still good enough in my opinion.

Visually, Code Vein offers environments that are both stunning and bleak, fitting well with the game’s theme. However, the beauty of these environments is somewhat diminished by a lack of variety within the same area.

Each location, while initially impressive, quickly becomes repetitive, offering little in terms of new scenery or unique elements as you progress. The level design primarily consists of corridor mazes, which can feel monotonous and detract from the overall exploration experience.

The story is probably the strongest aspect of the game, along with its characters. I found it genuinely enjoyable to follow the narrative and learn more about each character.

Overall, I think this game is good enough to be recommended to anyone who enjoys Souls-like games.",True,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Code Vein is a very cosy anime version of Dark Souls. It's one of the few proper souls-likes that have nearly the same mechanics, but more streamlined. It has bonefires, estus, currency dropped on death, respawning enemies, looping level design, stamina based combat, rolling, blocking, parries, equipment load mechanic and animation locks.

It builds upon what Dark Souls established by expanding and upgrading the mechanics. Weapon transformation makes sense unlike in DS1 and you can teleport between bonefires freely from the start. Code Vein also builds upon looping level design taking it to the next level. The infamous Cathedral of Sacred Blood is peak level design with an insane amount of loops and nonlinear multi level exploration.

When it comes to difficulty Code Vein is far on the ""easy"" part of the spectrum. Companions deal an insane amount of damage, can revive you and will even mark enemies or exploration points on map. Sure you can disable them, but the game was designed around having a companion so some fights (mainly the dual boss fight) will be extremely annoying without a companion.

Code Vein also features an amazing character creator which is honestly one of the best character creators out there. It gives so many customisation options that even Cyberpunk or Monster Hunter games feel limited in this aspect.

While amazing, Code Vein is not perfect. Memories are a boring way to tell the side stories. There are way too many cutscenes. I felt like 30% of the gameplay was just watching cutscenes. And lastly the worst part - The Depths. The Depths take everything Code Vein has and turn it into shit. Maps are repetitive and boring, you refight the same enemies and exploration is so linear you would think the design was outsourced to Ubisoft. And the worst thing about The Depths is that you cannot skip them if you want to see all the story and unlock all the skills.

CODE VEIN,"Honestly, felt like I was playing a long demo. In terms of the gameplay, combat, mechanics, animations, a lot of, well, everything, was very unpolished, not fully fleshed out, not smooth, janky, wonky, clunky, the list goes on. Area designs aside from 3-4 places were cool, nothing to scream home about though. Boss designs/fights, some were mid to alright, others were actually pretty dope

The games whole concept/idea though was probably my favorite thing, in addition to having a great character customization, and the story, while it could've been told better, was nice. The NPCs were also cool, though sometimes the voice acting would feel a bit flat. Lastly, I actually really liked the memory sequences, just wished you weren't slow walking in them all the time

I'm at a part people say to spend 2+ hours grinding xp/currency to overcome, and I just don't know if I have the energy for that. There's no other areas to go to instead.

CODE VEIN,"The game has the worst auto save system of ANY Souls Like, and on top of that it has some of the worst areas ever made for any kind of game. You just completed one of the most hated areas in the game without dying, got more than a million ""souls"" and went out to reload the area for an NPC sidequest because you don't want to respawn all of the 100+ endgame enemies you just killed while exploring? Well, fuck you! Because the game only auto saves when you rest on the ""bonfires"", so now you just lost 2 hours of progress in one of the most lazy, confusing and boring areas of the entire game.

Cathedral of Sacred Blood is a lazy, boring, confusing area that has no good rewards in the form of lore, design, items or quests for you, but it will consume more than an hour or two of your life because the map is made to be purposely confusing so it can add bloat and artificial content to the game. But HEY, you finished the map, so surely another one like that would not be present in the game right? Well, fuck you again, because there are two more maps like this, with the final one being bigger and more confusing.

While the combat has some cool abilities, the difficulty of the game is completely artificial, with ganks of 20+ enemies rushing at you through the entire map (those invasions are a main mechanic), backstab hitboxes that are completely bugged, attacks with animations that are almost instantaneous so you only know that an attack happened when you are on the ground with half+ of your health missing, enemies that are able to stagger you while armed with a wet noodle (imagine how great it is with 3 - 4 enemies attacking you at the same time) while you are not able to stagger then unless you use Gut's sword, bugged enemies that just flip through the map and cancel an entire event, forcing you to rest and restart the whole fight, etc.

Another beautiful thing, there is no out of the box exploration in this game's maps. On top of being incredibly lazy with the design, sometimes you find yourself in a map that has more vertical exploration and see that you can fall down on an area bellow to explore it. You go on, take the leap, and guess what, your character is instantly killed, without even starting the falling animation, because the devs want to force you to follow one path and one path only while exploring certain paths, something that goes against all that is used in other maps with ledges and vertical exploration.

The story is ok, the combat is acceptable considering the flashy abilities, and the aesthetic of the game is good, but god I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone to buy this game. This is coming from the guy that likes to plat every souls like game, no matter how great or shitty they are.",False,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Cautious recommendation. 

There was a meme that referred to Code Vein as “anime Dark Souls” up to its’ release back in the day, and for better and worse that seems right on the money after my playthrough. Unfortunately, the combat in this game just feels a little “off” to me in a way that Dark Souls and Monster Hunter don’t. It’s also clear that they wanted to cater more to coop play than Dark Souls does, which is fine but does contribute to some additional unevenness in single player. For the most part the difficulty of the game doesn't get too out of hand, though it is clearly balanced around using an AI companion. The companions differ slightly in terms of fighting style, but differ even more in terms of effectiveness.

This game is definitely not for everyone especially given it’s occasional focus on T&A, but I had fun with the story and world (except the level design of the Anor Londo ripoff). [spoiler] RIP Oliver. [/spoiler]

CODE VEIN,"My absolute favorite Soulslike. The amount of customization, both cosmetic and practical, is absolutely insane, and it is extremely fun to play around with. Unfortunately, not all of the weapons are that unique or even good, but you can generally beat the game relatively well with any type of build. I do wish bosses had a bit less resistance to the elements so magic worked against them, but that is probably the only gripe I have with the game. Recommend 100%",True,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"I like most of this game. It has some good mechanics that are a bit faster and more intuitive than most souls-likes. I also like the extrensive lore and story it brings, together with the wide options for character creation.

Some downsides: restoring the vestiges gets old after a while (I only found out hours into the game that they can be skipped). The white cathedral level: the level design almost made me want to end myself IRL. The items and scaling are not very intuïtive.

Also: Blade bearer and cannoneer have to be one of the most BS fights I've gotten into in any game.",True,Strategy

CODE VEIN,"One of my favorites soulslike games.
Even though it can't be compared to Elden Ring or Dark Souls, the game has quite good different mechanics and build system, and that made me love it.
The game has good designs. the soundtracks are amazing and the boss fights are quite well suited to the game's reputation, which isn't much compared to others soulslike games.
 Although the exploration is A LITTLE confusing and can make you go round and round on some maps to find 
important items, I love the combat and the game itself (the lvl reputation achivement was so pain)",True,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Recommended for people who, like me, are anti souls-like difficulty. No time for those learning curves, but wants an experience of beating one. This is the game for it.
Code Vein is extremely forgiving for a souls-like. AI companions are actually competent and can carry you & you can retrieve half of lost haze (souls) by taking a soak on hotspring.
Combat is good & character creation is very great. This is a good game.",True,Strategy

CODE VEIN,"I like that you can repeat bosses and master them.
You can't really do that in souls games without tricking the system by returning to camp at last second or installing mods or just playing again.
I like the flexibility of the builds and while the learning curve is about a play through long, it makes the seconds play through very satisfying.
The story is tragic across the board and begins to feel like a washed out gimmick but the game is fun.

CODE VEIN,"This game was recommended to me by a friend because I was looking for other action games. When I checked the reviews, I was a bit wary because some players said that this is just ""a porn game"".

After playing the demo, purchasing and now having just cleared the second Successor, I can recommend this game. Questions about humanity and existentialism are tackled in its story. And if you don't care about that, the action is challenging but not frustrating. Check out the demo if you're unsure.

The whole game is clunky and slow while the enemies consistently attacks you leaving no windows to heal or regenerate stamina, unless you have an ally to take aggro, and when you get hit you are always stunned for about a second leaving enemies to hit you again and stun locking you until their whole chain attack is done. The level design and enemy placement is abysmal making you almost always fighting 3+ enemies at the same time on top of the bad combat. The healing animation takes way too long to finish and barely heals you until about half way though the game. Character customization is not the best either only having a few selections of faces and clothes and then it being covered by a mask and blood veil.",False,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"I will unashamedly admit, I bought this game for two very superficial reasons: 1) it featured vampires wearing visual kei inspired outfits and 2) it featured music from HYDE. In that respect, the game did not disappoint. The game boasts a lot of customization, beautiful outfits, and lots of opportunities to pose for screenshots. With respect to everything else, I would not recommend playing this unless you love the Dark Souls type genre and have lots of time to kill.

Pros:
- Beautiful visual kei / goth inspired outfits
- Plenty of character customization options
- Music by VAMPS
- Lots of skills allowing for different play styles
- Vague dystopian story that is interesting when it makes sense
- Characters that are interesting enough

Cons:
- Ugly environments that blur together and get stale fast
- Maps that were designed by a sadist (the Cathedral begs for a cheat mod)
- Grindy and tedious gameplay (made worse by the fact you need to finish the game at least 3 times to get all 4 endings!)
- Limited guidance and direction leading to easily missable content (a walk-through is highly recommended)
- A story that can be nonsensical at times with a plot full of so many holes its Swiss cheese
- Tedious vestige restoration mechanic that gets boring fast

Overall I would recommend this to those that really like the genre and don't mind the grind. Otherwise, you'll find better out there.",False,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Easily one of the WORST Souls-like game I've ever played in my entire life. This game has some of the clunkiest and janky animations and INSANE clothing/armor clipping issues until its not even funny. This abomination of a game is truly a wonder to behold.

The Coop Ai partner is unfathomably useless 95% of the time, you can have all the aggro in the world and they'll just sit there and watch and do nothing. I've seen my Ai partner do 10 dodges in a row in a corner of a boss fight fighting his inner demons while the boss destroys me.

Mother of GOD it doesn't stop there, just when you think it can't get worse, ooh it absolutely does. The combat is atrocious and some of the WORST I've ever seen, there is no aggro/enmity system here. You CAN NOT GET AGGRO and its random but MOST of the time the enemy will just full on target you and completely ignore your useless lobotomized Ai partner.
The healing in this game is so small and substantial EVEN WITH HEALING BUFFS it feels like putting a hello-kitty bandaid on a severely broken skull fracture.

The screen shaking is also another huge problem in this game and some bosses where you NEED to lock on will just send you to the toilet after puking your brains out from how nauseating their movement is. The level design is absolutely abysmal every level feels the same, every level feels like you die by pitfall drops every level has some ungodly amount of something VERY ANNOYING that'll piss you off. 

This game is a 1/10 and the ONLY redeeming factor of this game and why I finished it is because of boobs.

And oh boy i think i finally realizing it again why i was never wanting to continue the game after i decided to downloaded the game again.

The game is not that great (at least for a so called Souls-like anime game).. down to the not so interesting world building, not so interesting lore and dialogues, the AI aren't so much considered to be ""intelligence"", and (imo) bad control placement at least for controller user like me.

However, if you're just looking for a gooner souls-like, then hell yeah get in there. Fantastic mod support to help make the game slightly more enjoyable, and it was with mods alone I tolerated this game to the end. For it to STILL have a $60 price tag is an absolute JOKE, however.",False,Strategy

In fact, if given the choice between replaying Code Vein and dragging my balls through a field of magma-coated razor wires while being chased by a swarm of bees that each one of them got a personal saw, I’d happily accept my fate as a shredded human remain.

The combat feels like trying to fistfight a tornado while blindfolded, the AI is as useful as a wet paper bag in a hurricane.

CODE VEIN,"This game is Bloodborne on easy difficulty in terms of its base game content, but don't let that fool you; Code Vein has its own unique mechanics and methods of dealing with its various enemies that can take veterans of Dark Souls out of their comfort zones at a moment's notice.

But it shares enough in common with the mainline Dark Souls series, and with Bloodborne that you'll find your way through after a some trial, error, and acceptance. The story is okay, I mostly checked it out to get a better idea of what was going on but it felt par for the course in terms of Anime geared towards older teens and young adults. It is a product of its time when it comes to character customization.

It does have a satisfying audio feedback and nice enough visuals to keep the mind stimulated, as well as enough skill combinations, weapon combinations, and endings to warrant multiple playthroughs for the sake of experimentation. And like the Soulsborne titles, you are given substantial control over its difficulty (you can play with an a.i. companion or you can play alone, you can play like a tank or adopt a more damage based play-style, go for full or partial completion etc.).

Only things I don't quite like are most of its boss designs (hitboxes are the biggest culprits, damage even more so), some of the level designs (if you know the biggest culprit, you know; it lives up to its reputation), those are its biggest issues to me.

So I took a step back from the game and asked myself the question ""...did I even have fun these last days and want to return?""

No. Not really.

My first experience with this game, which already brought me 98% to the point of refunding it, was the absolute mess of getting my custom controls saved. Looking in forums this is a...bug/feature(?) which exists for over 5 years now and obviously still hasn't been adressed. This gives me the impression, that the devs doesn't care at all for their players, when not even such elemental functions work properly - in my 30 years of playing video games I've never had to ""fight"" this hard, to convince a game to please just save my settings. And also wtf is wrong with the complete failing of getting my resolution right? The worst rip off bootleg indie games do a better job in setting my resolution right lol

When I was finally able to play the game it was...eh. I have the impression, that this game took a lot of inspiration from the X(³) series (duh, both being Sci Fi Space Flight Sims), while at the same time doing basically everything worse than the older X games...designs, controls, menus, functions, etc.
Yes, the universe is gigantic...but is that necessarily good? Who cares how big it is, if there's simply not really anything to explore or see? Sure, that's how it is with space, but it seems to me that the sheer size of the map is used as a sales pitch. Other open world games also get (justifiably) criticised for advertising gigantic worlds...which are completely barren and empty. Surface scanning and looking for stuff to scan on planets felt quite tedious to me, like a chore. Mining wasn't much better. But also fighting felt quite clunky and awkward. I don't know each ship, but I found it weird, that all that I saw only had weaponry facing to the front...where are turrets to the side and back? Is it just a death sentence to stick to the enemy's tail?
The music in this game is completely unremarkable. I think I wouldn't remember any song. I couldn't even say, how many there are...too few? Enough? I don't know. Nothing worth noting.

Elite Dangerous,"""Elite Dangerous"" presents itself as an ambitious and evolving title within the space simulation genre. The game offers a vast, open-world experience that allows players to engage in various activities such as trading, exploration, and combat, all set against the backdrop of a realistically rendered Milky Way galaxy. 

While ""Elite Dangerous"" boasts impressive graphics and a deep, immersive universe, it is important to note that the game remains a work in progress. Many players find that the experience is significantly enhanced when playing with friends, as cooperation and teamwork can add layers of strategy and enjoyment that solo play may lack.

Despite its potential, the game still faces some challenges that prevent it from achieving its full promise. Certain aspects of gameplay can feel incomplete or lack the depth expected from a title of this scale. As a result, some players may find that their experience does not fully meet their expectations at this point in its development. 

However, it is encouraging to see that the developers are actively working on updates and improvements, indicating a commitment to enhancing the overall experience. The community surrounding ""Elite Dangerous"" is also robust, with players sharing tips, strategies, and experiences, which can help new players acclimate to the game’s complexities.

In summary, ""Elite Dangerous"" is a noteworthy endeavour with significant potential that shines brightest when enjoyed in a multiplayer setting. While it may not fully satisfy every player at this stage, it is evident that the game is on a trajectory toward improvement, making it a title worth keeping an eye on as it continues to develop.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,Awesome graphics and endless options.,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Great game if you can figure it out. Think of it as a feature rich software with extremely poor documentation, there's so much depth to this game but it does a HORRIBLE job explaining itself, and good luck looking for information on it via your favorite search engine, you quickly run into 2 problems, 1. This game has gone through a number of iterations so not all info is relevant to the current version, and 2. The community is ""touched"". You'll notice nobody can seem to answer a question without nonsensical anecdotes, or meandering gibberish, its somewhat maddening.

So if you like trial & error with a bit of punishment then you'll have a great time. The rest of you, you'll have fun, have no doubt about it, but this game will just tick you off because there was something that you would think was important information and it just glosses over it. For example, wait until you get your modules all knocked out and then you don't know how to mitigate for it, in fact it's a side-note in an unrelated tutorial that essentially goes ""You can turn your modules on and off sometimes."" lol wtf...

It's absolutely an acquired taste and definitely not made to please everyone, but if immersive space sims are your jam there's no game that offers this level of fidelity, depth, variety and smooth and stable gameplay.

Elite Dangerous,"I'm a new player. The game is really fun, but kinda difficult to get the hang of. The graphics are solid and there seems to be a lot to do. The only thing this game is missing is ""SHIP INTERIORS"". It would put the other space sims to shame if it did. Not having ship interiors was the reason i didn't buy this game for so long. Someone tell the makers to do this.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Elite is a game that is as wide as an ocean, and as deep as a puddle. The game features stunning vistas, absolutely phenomenal sound and art design, and is a 1:1 recreation of the Milky Way. As you can see by my playtime, you can get a ton of hours out of this game. 

Unfortunately, Elite is owned/developed by Frontier Developments. Frontier, in my opinion has dropped the ball time and time again with Elite. The gameplay is slow, which while that does fit the theme- gets annoying real fast. The game itself is very grindy, and virtually nothing is explained in game. As a result, there is a very large learning curve; that is fun to get over,  but it will cause a ton of frustration.

New updates are few and far between. Most ""new content"" is recycled from other parts of the game. Last year, was the first time since 2018, that a new ship was introduced. That ship is now part of Frontier's early access model, wherein you can pay to use the ship with real money. Or you can wait three months, and buy it ingame for credits(the non- real money in game currency). This has soured me on Elite Dangerous, but as most of these ships are available for credits now- most new players should be fine.

I've been playing since 2018, and while it is a fun game- it is very time consuming. Other players far more articulate then me, discuss ED's numerous failings on the steam review page. I would highly recommend reading those reviews as well. 

As for me, I will give this game a solid 6/10. I highly recommend buying this game, and the Odyssey DLC on sale.

Final score: 6/10",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Hands down, the best space mining simulator I have come across. Yes, lot's of people enjoy the pew pew. In my opinion, the beauty starts with vectoring into a planetary ring system or watching a local nebulae shift the color palette of the asteroid belt you're operating out of. Maneuvering through tight spots with massive rocks moving on 3 axis, the unpredictable nature of space. Collision avoidance warning you just how close you are to space death. The binary beams of a pulsar can pull your ship apart while trying to scoop energy for the next jump in some remote part of the galaxy. Balancing how much fuel you have with the increased weight from a large haul you just mined to connect with some distant space station. Watching your drones buzz in and out of your fuselage as they collect ore freshly clipped from your mining lasers. This is Elite Dangerous, and it is a breathtakingly rendered version of our neck of the galaxy.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Chronically unfun Space Truck Simulator. The latest update, Trailblazers, made the shallow haul gameplay loop even worse.

Elite Dangerous,"It's No Man's Sky! But in reverse!
aka: Elite:Dangerous Devolution DLC

So, I've owned the game for like 10 years.  I had stopped playing not long after the Horizons DLC came out since it was game breaking and I didn't want to buy it.  Was suppose to add in planetary landing and driving around on beautiful planets and moons with a bunch of vehicles to allow you to do that...  can engineer you ship fittings...  the engineering thing was a random number generator of what you got,  only 1 rover with word of ""many more to come""  and horrible fps if you tried to land.

Just came back to the game 2 weeks ago and the ship side of things is still the same as it was, fun.  They gave me Horizons for free,  they changed the engineering stuff a little but otherwise the DLC looks unfinished.  Planet side you drive around in a rover that handles badly and shoot rocks (they said there would be multiple types of rovers but only delivered 1 in 10 years).  Horrible gameplay that I didn't want to pay for then, and wouldn't pay for now.  They never finished the DLC in the 10 years it's been out.  Extended vacation for the devs is my only guess on that.

Now the new DLC... you can get out and walk around on those horrible looking planets and take samples of horrible looking ""plants.""  Again, another DLC, 10 years on,  that delivers what looks like a discounted Temu pocket console version of No Man's Sky.  I won't be buying it either.  But they did add another moon rover... a single rover was added that requires you to buy this dlc... what happened to the rovers we were told we'd get with the prior dlc?  The plants look like something you'd see in a itch.io tech demo.  

For now the only thing keeping the game alive is their selling of ships through their cash shop.  Apparently they are experiencing an uptick in players,  but like myself... they won't be sticking around due to the lack effort put into the game by the developer.

So the list of the bad:
  Planets:  walk/drive around in a desert or on a giant ice cube looking at random rocks or really poorly drawn plants.  If it was the late 90's this would be acceptable.  Devs went on vacation after release of Horizons.
  Engineering:  completely destroyed any balance in the game.  Some changes were made to engineering, then the devs went on vacation.  And that leads us to the next problem:
  Balancing:  Devs went on vacation.  It's an unbalanced mess that hasn't been touched since release.
  Fighters:  destroys FPS, again... Devs went on vacation instead of fixing it.
  Multicrew:  Have your friends fly with you in your ship,  got added and then the devs went on vacation and never finished it.
  Ships for IRL money:  ok,  early access to ships to help beta test... ok, cool with that.  But it's turned into a ""pay to win"" model to help pay for.......... the devs going back on vacation.
  The New Ships: some are tied to the Horizons DLC, others tied to the latest DLC.  They don't tell you which they are tied to.  Most of them are just rehashes of the same model with a few minor changes.  They went on vacation before sending out the memo to their customers.

  If the devs could come out of retirement and do what Hello Games did with NMS and fix the problems, balance the ships,  finish the things they started,  make it look like a 2025 title and not some Temu/Itch.io technical demo that would be great!  Or just shut down the servers and say ""Well boys,  we tried and we are giving up... pip pip cheerie oh!""  would work as well.",False,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Simply the best space sim on the market.  Elite had its best year ever in 2024, and the new road map and current newest content, the colonization system, seem to be doing the exact same again.  I highly recommend giving Elite a shot.  It's a very steep learning curve, and it's not perfect, but if it clicks with you, you'll fall in love.",True,Strategy

Specifically, Elite Dangerous' combat and exploration are far more realistic and immersive than NMS, making it an awesome Sci-Fi combat game. The only downside to this game , however, is its sparse player base. There are very few players online nowadays, but I guess that factor could be contributed to the vast loneliness of space.

8/10, would recommend",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"I play Elite in VR and there is no better Space Sim for VR.  The views are breath taking.  When you first fly up to a planet and see the scale of the titan in front of you getting larger and larger the closer you get you start to feel very small.  Seeing it on a regular monitor can't portray the scale.  Rocketing through a canyon or dog fighting in an asteroid field is exhilarating.  Not only is the visuals outstanding, but the game play and endless options are one of a kind in this game.  You can hunt pirates or be a pirate yourself, mine precious materials in the rings of a planet, or explore the billions of stars in our galaxy and sell the cartographic information you gathered from each solar system you visit.  This game has been around for many years and has had its ups and downs, but has never stopped being the best Sim game I have ever played.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"This game could be fun if it actually explained anything. Instead, you’ll have to sit through a 40-minute YouTube tutorial just to figure out the most basic stuff. Accidentally get too close to a sun? Better dig through Reddit to learn that you need to manually disable certain ship modules or you’ll overheat and die. Missions? Yeah, good luck. I just wanted a simple non-combat transport job, thought I picked the right one—nope. Turns out I had to land on a planet, which is way more complicated than it should be. You have to orbit in cruise control, then guess when you’re close enough to descend, otherwise, you’re stuck circling for 40+ minutes.

Oh, and apparently, you can accept missions your ship isn’t even equipped for. Failed my first two, lost reputation, and now they’re just sitting in my mission log with no way to remove them. Five hours in, and I still barely know how to get around. No clue how to return to my starting area or find missions again—guess it’s back to YouTube.

Elite Dangerous,"This game could have potential, but it fails so miserably. The controls are very difficult to get the hang of. I'm not sure why anyone though that putting the roll on the mouse was the best option over the yaw. One of my biggest issues is the cruise drive thing. They did add a ""helpful"" cruise assist that decides to work about 10% of the time. The other 90% you have to do it manually which means that without a ton of practice you're going to fling yourself past your destination multiple times and probably crash into things. The actual flying part also feels kind of awful. It's tricky to control and feels pretty unintuitive. Unintuitive pretty much describes this whole game. Another problem is that when you jump between systems, it dumps you right next to the star, and not only that, you're facing the star. So you have to turn in another direction to avoid getting pulled in as soon as you start your engines. You also have to fly at an awkward angle away from the place you want to get to if it ends up on the other side of the star from you because you're so close. Anyway, it's mostly just a bunch of small things that I have a problem with. You'll get a better experience playing No Man's Sky, since it has all the things you can do in this game and more but without the crappy controls and having to rubber band your way to your destination.

With less than 0.03% of the galaxy explored (after 10 years), the sheer scale of the galaxy is still crazy to think about even to this day.

Elite Dangerous,"In general, compared to the similar games, this one is good but still has a lot space to develope.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"What really kills this game is too much realism. There is also very little in game help leaving you to have to figure out things on your own. Or just use the internet to look stuff up. What really killed this game for me though was when I began to realize that its basically a free to play MMO game. Majority of the missions that you do in this game are repetitive and offer little to no reward. Sure there are about 7 different types of missions to do, but once you've done one mission in that category, then you've done them all. You can spend 2 hours searching through asteroid belts to refine the 10 minerals that you need for a quest turn in. Or you can get the exact same amount of money for delivering 10 units of coffee to the neighboring Solar System, that can be loaded into your ships cargo hold at the current station.

There is a lot of customization in this game as far as ship modules are concerned, which is cool at first. But the more that I got into setting up my ships I quickly realized that there is only one true set up for each ship depending on what I'm wanting to do with it. Basically a fighter type ship can't be used to do anything except space combat and that had better be in the same solar system, because their jump capabilities are extremely limited. And a transport ship is not agile enough or equipped with enough hard points to be effective in combat. You are able to get the 7 or so basic ship types relatively easy but the customization options are limited unless you want to put REAL money into the game...

All in all at the time of writing this I've put 97 hours into the game. I've had a lot of fun playing and figuring out how this game works, but don't intend to put anymore time into it. Graphics are amazing, ship controls are cool, and the world set up is great (the space part. Space ports are bland and repetitive and majority of planets are barren). BUT the game play is EXTREMELY stale. I've played this game from the start with a HOTAS setup for ship controls and Xbox controller for on foot missions. I'd give this game a 6.8 out of 10. If you're looking for a fun space exploration game, then I'd recommend No Man's Sky over this.",False,Strategy

Elite Dangerous,"I have been playing this game on/off for years. Some days it feels like space trucking, at other times, it's a fun adventure. It really depends on what type of missions you do, and what your ship's capability is. The best and worst part is that unlike games like GTA V, you can't buy success. You either make money or you don't, but you can't just run a credit card to win. You have to do the work. I do appreciate their new update that allows you to colonize the galaxy. Starfailed and No Man's Sky already have those features.

I will note what also feels lacking. Don't even bother with ground missions, Frontier really has some work to do. Stealth mechanics are nearly non-existent. I was honestly looking forward to it, because in most games I end up playing as a thief, rogue, mercenary, assassin, or hunter. It feels like ground & vehicle missions were an afterthought rather than a fully-integrated part of the game. As for team mechanics, you can't fully share missions with your team either unless you see the blue triangle logo on the mission. It doesn't feel natural. In the military, if the leader had a mission, the entire wing/platoon would also have the mission.

In this game is something for everyone: Exploration, PVE, PVP, Bounty-Hunting, Mining and so much more...

Positive:
- 600+ hours playtime, and the game didnt get boring
- Massive Open World Game (1:1 simulation of our Milkyway)
- The Moons, Planets, Stars etc. are insanely beautiful
- Great Control-Mechanics (Controller)
- Everything in this Game just feels satisfying (Jumping from system to system, flying, battles)
- immersive like no other game ive played

Negative:
- Many Bugs
- The dlcs destroyed the Game (for me)",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Very good video game. Extremely well polished exploration / combat / mining / trading systems. Fair warning though, this game has no hand holding. Its highly recommended you check out 3rd party websites like inara.cz to get info on good places to grind.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"This is far and away my favourite game, and has been since the moment I first ran it.
I've been a huge fan of space sims and sandbox games for many years, and ED marries those two genres really well. I love everything about it, the graphics, the ship-based and on-foot gameplay, the ship choices and the ability to configure them in a large number of ways, the massive amount of choice of activities in-game, the list goes on and on. The sound design is superior to any game I've played in terms of immersion and quality. At this price, you'd be hard-pressed to get this much entertainment value per currency unit.

The Steam version runs great on Linux with little tinkering. This is actually my alt account as I have over 500 hours on my account directly from FDev. It was so cheap here on Steam that I couldn't resist.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Don't get me wrong, Elite Dangerous is an excellent game... expansive, beautiful, exciting, and nearly overwhelming detail.  And it is also a game about a story mostly in your (& maybe any human teammates) head:  wait... Why are those ships following me?  Are my friends online so we can take them?  Why do I want to get in good with  the ranks of a dubious blue syndicate or explore deep space and rescue new players as a fuel rat? ).  And sometimes it can be a game that is be mostly about waiting (in various guises - travel, lurking, seeking, researching).  Or grinding (so many kinds of materials, data, elements, rare goods, synthesis, star ships, gear, equipment..).   I've put in 200 hours over nearly a decade and I'm certain I'm still unlocking, finding or learning new content.   

A little of the content doesn't appeal to me (black markets don't seem more profitable than hauling potatoes.. tho if those are ""hot"" potatoes you'll need that black market.)   This is nit picking - other human players might be all about blowing up ships just to get those hot  potatoes.    And that human element is maybe the best and worst thing about the game.   Grind 20 hours and loose it all to a team of players that  just wants to blow up your ship to get rare ship debris and you might be a bit put off.

You can play solo, in a massive multiplayer dangerous universe, or with just a few friends.  

I appreciate what Frontier Developments has accomplished here with this epic.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,It was pretty good but sometimes the graphics could be wonkey.,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,Best multiplayer space sim available. A large dedicated group of friendly players should keep this game playable for a long time! Keep the content coming!,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Best Space ships from any ""space game"" that i have played yet. Sound design is absolutely crazy. Some people might say that the grind is a little much but for me it is justified by the epicness of ramming little ships with my 400 ton anaconda at 250 meters per second just to see them be blowed into dust. Game feels like a grandparent to the not in steam hosted ""star citizen"" (with this im not saying that the one game is better then the other, i love both). Havent played much in open Sessions just solo but pve works great for me. It can get pretty intense at times when a high level encounter strips my shields and cracks my hull to 13%. Also the game has potential for those cool low fly montages, tho i still need to find a correct graphics setting combo to remove noise from the ground.

Havent encountered any bugs in my 243 hours of playtime. 

Altogether I 100% recommend this game for people that just want to fell what it is like flying a big or small ship with immense power.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Really enjoyed this game. If you're into exploration, or even into space shootouts, this game is for you.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,by far the best acquisiton I made here. you just need to spend some time to get used to its mechanics. get ready to be addicted (lot of stuff to do on the game),True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Space, Pirates, Explorers, political intrigue and a huge amount of 3rd party support make this game pretty great!",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,for me a perfect blend of sim and gamey mechanics,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"I find this to be more of an experience than a game. It takes a dedicated person to truly experience what this game has to offer.  If you like space, dog fighting, cargo hauling, etc. This is the game for you, but don't expect it to be a game you play for 10 hours and have everything, because it takes a lot longer than that",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,Great game big sand box feel spend my free time exploring new galaxies.,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,It is quite fun.,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"I'd like:
- a better keyboard and mouse support. Not just flying, but the UI (mouse cursor toggle, please) and ESPECIALLY the SRV. Like they never played another game where you control something with wheels.
- more than 2 weapon group hotkeys. They hadn't played Mechwarrior games either.
- Match Speed to Target keybinds, one for current speed, one as a toggle, to refresh constantly.
- the 5-second timer after jumpdrive charges up removed. There's a lot of jumps in this game and every time I have to listen to ""4. 3. 2. 1. Engage."". Can't do anything else during that time. I doubt it's a camouflaged loading screen because they could've made the target system start loading as soon as it's targeted. It takes over 40s between system jumps if you do it on the spot, as fast as possible, with an SSD.
- more info in the game. Anything public knowledge available online should also be in the game. Reports of Guardian sites, resource deposits, rich asteroids, etc. Anything you don't sell on the black market should mark its origin on the map as public knowledge.
- for the Galaxy Map to get fixed. To be able to select multiple filters, to enlarge the system dots when there are very few visible, to save the current filters for easier selection later, to apply colors and symbol combination to bookmark icons, etc.
- for the target object rotation to show relative to you, not absolute. For example, if an enemy fighter is on my tail, aimed at me, I'd like to see his hologram image pointed at my face. As it is, I'm looking at his rear thrusters. Would also be useful in Supercruise, when aligning to a station so you can dock faster and easier.
- to be able to buy reusable limpets. I'm not saying disposable ones are bad. Some people prefer them to be that way. But there's no option to collect and reuse those robots. Many people find that annoying. 
- more info on equipment. Reload speeds on weapons. Weapon and sensor stats on fighters, etc.
- to be able to view the map during loading screens. They happen way too often to justify the loss of such functionality.
- all known materials to be listed in the Codex Knowledge Base, so I don't have to resort to Google to find something in the Synthesis menu.

Due to some of the notes above, much of my play time is the game just running in the background while I'm browsing the Internet. There are several other features people want changed/added to the game, but the ones above are what bothers me specifically. 
Despite its flaws however, the game is nice to play with a friend or two. Then again, so are many other games.

The game has a lot of potential and is is active development. You can look forward to nice things.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,This is one of my favorite games of all time. I frequently recommend this game to people who are a fan of the idea of open world space flight games.,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Incredibly big, realistic and awe inspiring game. It's beautiful and utterly engaging. One of the best I have played. You can play in many different styles - bounty hunter, trader, explorer, jack-of-all-trades, military - and plenty of upgrades and designing etc for you to minmax to your hearts content. Well done Frontier. I first played the 1982 Elite and have been hooked since- but this is something else.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous," Controls are terrible. It takes forever to do anything. Was completely destroyed on my very first mission that was supposed to be safe. Was like 10+ pirates on a salvage mission that was supposed to be a starter mission in a starter system with zero threat. They destroyed my ship as I was exiting it and I managed to kill one of them before the 2nd (of 10+) pirates insta-gibbed me.
 This wasn't fun and I don't care enough to figure out how you're supposed to recover from losing everything on your first mission.",False,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Steep learning curve but so immersive all the way through. Love the direction the developers have been going the past year. Looking forward to more and more. Still wishing they'd fix on foot VR because in ship is great. And that they could somehow bring in ship walk arounds and more to do on foot in general. Already at a relatively great price but grab it on sale if you're still on the fence. For the last year or so, they have definitely earned the asking price and then some.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"This is a fantastic game with long-term playability.   It is immersive and can be as exciting or as relaxing as you would like it to be.   My home away from home is in the black.  I love the graphics and physics.  Options for ship engineering and load-outs are numerous.  You choose to play offline, in a password protected instance that only you and those you choose can play, or play online and interact with others and all that brings.  No matter which you choose, the results carry over into the other instances.  Great Game.  If give it a 10/10",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"I started playing Elite Dangerous when it first came out. Back then, I didn't really ""get"" it. But a few years of inhaling every space sim I could get my hands on, I have come back to see what I missed the first time around with ED. I have to say, I played this for about a week, then bought Odyssey, and that really sold it for me. The game is beautiful, there is lots to do. You get to make your own story, or play to the community goals.

I bought a flight stick so I could enjoy the flight even more, and that has been excellent so far. If you have previously passed on this game, I'd encourage you to give it another go, and get involved with the ~20k other players in the community.

See you out there commander, o7",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"A very polished game from its initial release, and lots to do. The ability to purchase ships is a lot more balanced as is the trading. I’m currently pirate hunting by filling my ships hold with precious metals as a bait. Hugely enjoyable game and recommended!",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,This game is what star citizen wishes it was. An absolute masterpiece. Community is top notch too.,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"First person EVE. The learning curve is a cliff, but worth the investment IMO. Not the most balanced game out there, but incredibly immersive and an overall incredible sandbox to play in. From trading to mining, bounty hunting, ferrying passengers, or deep space exploration, there are tons of activities to engage in and a lot of fun to be had if you invest the effort. This game will not hold your hand and I love it for it.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"This game keeps giving. I played a lot in 2021 and came back this year because the devs have added a lot of new content. I love a game with depth that you can pick up and put down. Gorgeous in VR, except for the on food exploration in Odyssey, but that's a whole other thing. Still worth it, look forward to more updates!",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"I've played them all and this is, imho, the best space sim on the market. The things that set it apart from the rest:

- [b]Commitment to realism[/b]: If you have more than a passing interest in astronomy, you will appreciate the detail put into designing the galaxy simulation, Stellar Forge. A 1:1 scale of our Milky Way, developed by actual astronomers and cosmologists, this is the closest you'll get (aside from simulators like Space Engine) to actually being able to explore distant stars.

- [b]The flight model[/b]: There are two flight models, assisted and unassisted. Assisted is the easy mode and will automatically make adjustments to your ship so that it mimics more of a traditional atmospheric model, but unassisted gives you complete freedom across all 6 DOF. I won't claim that none of Elite's competitors have decent ""flight assist off"" modes, but most are either too arcadey for my tastes or only give you limited freedom. Elite's FA off mode has a steep learning curve and is something you will never truly master. I think it will appeal to people who are into other flight simulators and were similarly unimpressed by the arcadey-ness of other titles.

- [b]Variety of activities[/b]: I prefer combat and exploration, but there is also mining, space trucking, piracy, alien combat, a complex political simulation that can be influenced by player actions, and soon to be colonization (where Fdev will give the players the ability to shape the galaxy by building their own star ports and settlements).

- [b]The community[/b]: I know most games have great communities of players who are incredibly passionate, and Elite is no different. Perhaps one of the best gaming communities I've ever been a part of. There are many players groups dedicated to the different play styles and activities, so it's easy to find a place where you fit in. Some of the most interesting events in the lore of this game were actually spearheaded by players. From the smaller niche groups, to the community at large, it's just a great thing to be a part of.

Elite has had an interesting history. The first game came out in 1984 and it has had an an unmistakable influence on the genre. The devs have not always given the game the love it deserves and the player base has been justifiably critical of that neglect, but the last year has been one of the busiest in terms of development in a long time and I feel confident in saying that now is a great time to either return, if it's something you enjoyed in the past, or to try out for the first time, if any of the points I mentioned above sound interesting. This game does not hold your hand, but it is very rewarding if you put in the time (and I've put in my fair share). It's absolutely my most favorite game of all time.

Hope to see you out in the black.

Elite Dangerous,"Came back to Elite. Kinda. Played it about 40 years ago on my C64. And it is as captivating now as it was then. But oh-so-much prettier.

I love the little and not so little nods to the original. But I also love that is so much more now. The universe is huge (again) but not boring/empty. There are so different ways how to play it. And so much to do. 

The grind is not as bad as some complain. I admit: I purchased a proper trader ship to get started. Then fell in love with exploring.  But with an intermezzo of bounty hunting.

The community is great, nice 3rd party websites and a very helpful r/EliteDangerous sub-reddit. Guys, you rock!

One point substracted for the launcher. But at least it is one of the less bothersome.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,The game is exciting and challenging.  The community is great and always willing to help and share unique places found in the universe that is vast and visually stunning.  I have purchased several copies to share with others and would love to see a sequel.  Thanks for all the entertainment you have provided for us all..,True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Amazingly well rounded game, large learning curve. once learned the game is a blast it always draws you back in.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"Wow, I thought this was not for me as I don't do multiplayer, but I just did not understand how this game worked. So much to learn, but that is one of the reasons this game is so fun. Using a Dual sense controller and is ok now I have a handle on basic combat manoeuvres.",True,Strategy
Elite Dangerous,"FAntastic all around space game. Mining, Combat, Exploration etc. you name it and it has it.",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,very fun better then bonelabs story but if u want mods play bonelab if u want story play boneworks,True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,Feels pretty good to play. SCARILY optimized. Wish it had more weapon variety tbh.,True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"Super great game, amazing physics, extremely interactive, and satisfying story. Also has many other game modes, you won't get bored. However, 30$ is a bit much, I would wait for a discount or sale.",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"Boneworks isn’t just a game—it’s a full-body VR experience that pushes the limits of physics-based interaction. From the moment you step in, everything in the world reacts realistically to your movements, whether you’re climbing, vaulting over obstacles, or using objects as improvised weapons. The gunplay and melee combat feel incredibly satisfying, allowing for creative and tactical engagements against enemies. Unlike most VR games with simplistic mechanics, Boneworks encourages experimentation, rewarding players who use their environment to their advantage. It’s not just a shooter—it’s a sandbox where you can approach combat and exploration however you like.

While the physics system is impressive, it can sometimes feel clunky, and there’s a bit of a learning curve to mastering movement. The story, while intriguing, takes a backseat to the sheer fun of playing around with the game’s mechanics. That said, even years after its release, Boneworks remains one of the most immersive and innovative VR games out there. If you’re looking for a game that truly makes you feel present in a virtual world, it’s absolutely worth picking up—especially on sale. It’s a must-play for VR enthusiasts who love deep interaction and sandbox-style gameplay.",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,This game is legendary!! It is super realistic and also it is just a cool game.,True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"Still (in my opinion) one of the greatest VR games to be released. No game will top the physics and handling of this game. If you plan on playing the sequel, Bonelab, PLEASE play this game first. They are both AMAZING games but experiencing Boneworks and all it has to offer before hopping into its sequel is the best way to experience the Monogon world.",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"Raaahh best vr game out there half life alyx cant beat this, by the way try bonelab it feels a bit more open world but boneworks is still a masterpiece",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,Feels like Portal but VR. Good combat,True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"BONEWORKS is everything VR gaming should aspire to be. From its innovative mechanics to its seamless immersion, this game takes virtual reality to the next level. I absolutely love how the physics are integrated into every aspect of the gameplay—it’s incredibly satisfying to interact with the world in such a dynamic way. You can spend hours just experimenting with the weapons in the opening segment, and honestly, it never gets old.

What really sets BONEWORKS apart is the freedom it offers. The ability to grab, throw, and manipulate enemies is both thrilling and surprisingly fun. Plus, the gunplay feels natural and immersive, making every shootout intense and engaging. If you're looking for a VR experience that feels less like a game and more like an adventure in a fully interactive world, BONEWORKS is an absolute must-play.

Whether you're into intense combat or simply love messing around in a sandbox environment, this game has something for everyone.",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,It's good with mods. But the campain is the best out of every vr game i played so far (not as good as hla but close),True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"I like the story mod in boneworks i would make a guide how to beat story mode but im sill working on it love the things - Gorillavr35 
For: Boneworks team",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,Amazing story its great for its time you should get this game if you want story. the loading screens are long  but other than that you should get this game as long as you have the right PC your set.,True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"The story mode is so fun! The guns are satisfying to use, and the hand to hand combat is really fun.",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"i have'nt completed the game yet but its very fun everything is good like the grapics to the gameplay the game is perfect
",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"you may have seen this game on your tiktok feed doing trickshots, and may be wondering: :""is it worth the money?"" Yes. The gameplay is very good, the interactions feel on point, and the campaign has exceptional level design.
The story gets so deep when you understand it.
I may have only 1.8 hours of gameplay as of this review, but i played the labworks (unoffical) port on bonelab (also worth getting), but im still glad i got this game. If youre new to vr, maybe wait a few months to get used to it, as theres a lot of throwing around in this game, but after, play it! You may be terrified by the crablets though :(",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"a pretty well-made game on top of being boundary-pushing. surprisingly unintimidating given how some people talk about it, just a fun and at times mildly scary adventure with some cool unlockable sandboxes and mechanically inventive physics interactions",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"fun but annoying to mod and bad with stickdrift
",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"So far I really like Boneworks. I only really just completed the Museum of Technical Demonstration, and i’m now in the city part. I did play Bonelab before this, so the physics are about the same. i’ll see how i like the game when i finish it tho",True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,The physics are very fun also the one thing that makes the game funner is the utility gun:)))))),True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,goated game that is still fun to play after bonelab,True,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"It's been a long time I played so shitty game for the last time. No plot, you just given the training grounds first and then you just walk and try to entertain yourself in the facility. No narration, you don't know the location you are based on, how did you get there. The only thing you know by some labels, that you are in the museum, that's it. You don't know who are these enemies you are fighting, why they look like that, you just silently going through some locations and you have no idea what you are doing. 

Also, the fight and physics mechanics are really bad, it's hard to climb something, fight enemies, since you clip through them. 

Weird thing that they constantly give you ammo but no gun, so you just have all these magazines, but you cannot use them. 

Complete waste of money and dissapointment, it's one of my first PCVR games and I didn't know that I can meet something of that poor quality. I wish I could make a refund.",False,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"The ""realistic"" physics feel restrictive and very sickening at times",False,Strategy
BONEWORKS,"playable tech-demo with a game as an afterthought, very boring and forces you to play through the awfully uninteresting story mode for sandbox stuff",False,Strategy
BONEWORKS,sooooooooooo fricin good way better than bonelab buy this it cheaper than bone lab and just better i love it,True,Strategy

Resident Evil 4,"RE4 is great, but RE4:RE is so much better.

A lot of people bemoan about certain lines being cut and some of the humor being removed for a more serious presentation, and while I do see the merit in said arguments, to say that RE4:RE is a inferior product would be far off the mark.

Combat is better, atmosphere is incredibly better. People complained about yellow paint, I didn't find it much of a problem. It's somewhat difficult figuring out what can be interacted with and what not (dumpsters), so the yellow paint wasn't all that bad imo. Story was fun, and so were the characters. Not only does Luis feel so much better in this story, but his ending is so much more impactful when you take the time to read through the little bits of lore scattered across the village section.

Then, there's Ashley. I think her whole health rework works great, and her character is far, far better than RE4. She actually feels like a companion, and her character growth was great too. Best part was immediately after the beginning of C14 in how she sounds so confident when assisting Leon compared to before.

I had a couple of problems with this game, but nothing too major. Audio would sometimes glitch, the scopes are kinda blurry, but that's about it. Had a lot of fun going for 100% on this game, and would definitely recommend it to anyone else.

Отличная игра!",True,Strategy
Resident Evil 4,"When the fourth part remake first came out I didn't like the game too much, in particular I still don't like how they portrayed some of the characters from the original. But otherwise it's a great game!

Pros:
☑️🔝 The spirit of the original and the spirit of the Resident are preserved, the game is a pleasure to play; 
☑️🔝 Added the ability to create cartridges for weapons, first aid kits and other parts; 
☑️🔝 Attention to detail: you can get hooved in the face by a cow, can be obtained from a rooster, and also shoot rats, move a pig and more; 
☑️🔝 Also the addition of many small details that turned out to be simply wonderful. This is an interesting look at old things; 
☑️🔝 Leon's knife is capable of working real miracles in the game, and reflecting a saw, and attacks of evil monsters, a great innovation XD; 
☑️🔝 Changes for teams with Ashley. A very big plus is that you can command Ashley to stay away from the enemy when I shoot or do other things; 
☑️🔝 A huge plus is that you can start a new game again after completing the main game while keeping your existing weapons; 
☑️🔝 Completely changed Separate Ways for Ada Wong, 
☑️🔝 Addition of new puzzles that we have to solve. 

Cons:
✖️ The depiction of old characters: the look of the original and brutal Krauser, who with his appearance and words inspired fear and at the same time strength in 2005, in the remake his appearance brings pain and especially what he carries;
✖️ Ramon Salazar. I don’t quite understand why he was so disfigured in the remake, perhaps it was all done to please modern times, but looking at him became painful;
✖️ They removed cool, epic and awesome scenes from the original or simply remade them, which caused a lot of positive emotions. It feels like the authors had a goal to remove or change as much as possible what was simply Divine in the original. Perhaps all the changes, as well as the appearance of other characters, were of course done to please modern times, maybe someone will even like this. But personally, no, I didn’t like it;
✖️ Dialogues are not the strongest side of the remake;
✖️ Not every item can be put into storage.

Otherwise, it's a great game that's worth the money. I enjoyed the remake, even though it still has its downsides.",True,Strategy

The Separate Ways DLC is on part with the title. It's what Capcom always does, It's exceptional as it should be. As we know it's the same DLC as in the original.

Resident Evil 4,"This game is an absolute masterpiece. Easily the best third-person Resident Evil experience to date. The remake is packed with substance, offering a surprisingly long and satisfying journey with countless standout moments.

Without giving away spoilers, the game starts with an eerie trek through the forest, leading to iconic locations like the village, the church, and the catacombs. You’ll face off against a massive lake monster, ascend to an atmospheric and breathtaking castle, and navigate through a cave maze and a high-tech laboratory. That’s just the short version—there’s so much more to discover. The game is filled with memorable boss fights, cinematic cutscenes, and fun mini-games that add variety to the experience.

The game feels so much like the old RE4, and in some cases even better. The action is incredible, but in some moments it is terribly unbearable

The BIG undeniable flaw of RE4 Remake, which cannot be completely ignored, is simplifying or removing several challenging situations that were present or more engaging in the original version.",True,Strategy

Resident Evil 4,"Professional difficulty sucks all the fun out of this game, and exacerbates every issue with the game's balance.
For example: Breakable knife means grabs are lethal if your knife is broken, and it's especially bad when it comes to the first krauser fight THAT LIMITS YOU TO THE KNIFE ONLY. 
Stunlocks are way too common and frustrating, melee attacks have very little invincibility frames leading you to take unavoidable damage at the end of the animation, the parry mechanic is forced and unreliable, stealth is tacked on and is barely useful throughout the game, knife execute prompts sometimes don't work and the weapon balance is atrocious.
The bolt thrower is a meme with how terrible it is, and there is no point to it since the game always drops pistol ammo, so just use the pistol. 
The smgs are only good for staggers to use melee with (melee is dogshit, so why bother), the striker shotgun has disgusting spread, the magnums are too expensive to be worth it (upgraded bolt action/riot shotgun kill bosses just as reliably, with less investment, while also being useful in general), and the only pistols that are really worth the investment are the red9 and the blacktail, with the starting pistol being an ok choice. 
I really wanted to like this game, and lord knows I tried (3 clears on professional), but it just feels like a chore, the game actively punishes you for trying to do fun stuff, like going for suplexes, using stuff like the striker, using the knife to actually attack instead of using it as a dedicated sekiro parry etc. 
The fact that Capcom expects you to pay for separate ways, something that was part of the original game for free, plus the pay2win dlc really doesn't help either.",False,Strategy

Also there are WAY more than 4 evil residents, so be careful of that.",True,Strategy
Resident Evil 4,"In the modern day landscape of gaming, it seems many of the best we've gotten in recent years are remakes of classics (Last of Us, Dead Space, Silent Hill, etc.). Resident Evil has been a recipient of this treatment for a while now, since the release of RE2R in 2019. I haven't played the original 2 and 3, so I can't speak for their quality in terms of that comparison (though I'm told 3 is disappointing in this regard), but both of the remakes are good, overall fun experiences. However, I have played the original 4. This remake manages to capture many of the sections and aspects of the original that made it so fun and engaging, though much like the 2 and 3 remakes, there are a lot of things that have been left out. There was never going to be a chance that this game matched the original in terms of quality or status. That game is simply on another level. But all things considered, this is a good game, a fairly faithful remake, and on its on terms is an absolute blast.

I've played this remake probably 3 or 4 times over now, and each time is just as riveting as the last. While many of the sections from the original are removed (the lake segment is very different, you are no longer chased by a giant stone Salazar, etc.), the way they're set up here work well within their own context and setup. Gunplay is snappy and mimics that classic RE4 feel, while being modernized so that you don't have to stand still like an asshole while aiming (always hated that). Parrying is carried over, the merchant is still awesome, and the atmosphere of the game (while not as thick as the original), is still quite present. Professional is also still brutal, for anyone wondering about that.

I enjoy the modern RE games a lot, and this one might be my favorite outside of 8. My only real complaint with this game is that the voice acting in most cases is either very bland, or straight up bad (e.g. Ada) and the dialogue doesn't carry that same humor as before, with this game sounding more like a bad action movie rather than a corny one, which is the spirit the original was in 99% of its runtime. At least we still have the bingo line. Also, on the technical side, this game runs fairly well but can experience issues on somewhat older systems. Further, the VRAM requirement for this game at max is insane. Seriously, 13-14 gigs? Wild.

A very fun experience, and well worth the money now that Separate Ways and Mercenaries have been released. 9/10. Would play bingo with the merchant again.",True,Strategy

There were some cheap deaths for sure too, like [spoiler]walking over rickety planks too fast = fall to your death[/spoiler]. Or the aforementioned animation locking and getting hit by multiple things in a row without regaining control of your character before dying.

Highlights for me were the mine carts, [spoiler]fish boss[/spoiler], second last boss, and final escape sequence. I also liked how you could melee punish enemies after shooting them.

I haven't had the fortune of enjoying the original, but I have played a lot of Resident Evil games. RE5, RE7, 2&3 Remake. Total about 100 hours or so.

Now I am going for 100%, and it proves as a great challange, and offers a lot of replayability, ESPECIALLY if you don't do more than 2-3 achivements in a single playthrough, you would need about 5-8 to have anything and everything.

Ada was first mentioned in the original Resident Evil (1996), before being introduced as a supporting character and antiheroine in Resident Evil 2 (1998). The character was initially conceived as a researcher named Linda for the prototype of the second game, but her name was changed to Ada and she was rewritten as a spy and mercenary for the final build to connect its story to that of the original. Over the course of the series, Ada is often hired to steal biological weapons for various organizations, although she betrays her employers on numerous occasions to save protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from dire situations.",True,Strategy
Resident Evil 4,"Resident Evil 4 is the sequel to Leon's story following the events of RE2. It's an amazing experience that builds up on everything previously stabilished while also setting itself apart from other entries in the franchise. The whole game is a marvel of game design, with the changes made to the core gameplay being nothing short of fantastic. It sets itself apart by being a lot more action focused, but overall the gameplay is extremely satisfying. Other gameplay aspects like atmosphere, graphics and sound design are also incredibly well done and the characters really feel alive and real. While the game may not be as horror-like as it was before, it definetly compensates for that with fun new mechanics to explore and new ways to fight the enemy.

The first thing that makes RE4 so different from its predecessors is the main gameplay loop. RE2 had a very deep focus on horror, the game would literally lock you inside an abandoned police station, give you a knife and a gun and hope you came out of it alive. And it was awesome.
RE4, on the other hand, is a lot more focused on combat, since Leon is now actually a trained professional with honed skills and combat experience. One good comparison to make is how in RE2, killing enemies would be very rare. The only way to permanently kill an infected would be to blow their head off, which would take either a lot of luck or a lot of precious resources. So the game plan would usually boil down to [b]crippling[/b] your targets instead of trying to eliminate them. However in RE4, due to the nature of the new virus affecting the people, known as Las Plagas, enemies are a lot less resiliant, so killing them is not just viable, it's actually needed in most situations. To compensate for that, the game gives you every single tool you might need to actually get rid of your enemies, like more ammo, more options when choosing your combat tools and many more ways to deal damage to whatever's bothering you. 
One of those things is Leon's newfound skill to [b]kick the shit out of enemies[/b], or how he figured out that knives are actually pretty useful in most combat situations, so now you can, I dunno, PARRY ATTACKS???

All of these changes make actually [i]playing[/i] the game SO MUCH MORE FUN. You don't just run away anymore, you face that shit HEAD ON. It's entirely possible to be on kissing distance from an enemy and be completely safe as long as you have the tools and the skill to defend yourself. 
The game is also a lot more streamlined, with very little backtracking being required (but still possible and even encouraged sometimes), everything feels more dynamic and rewarding, and the combat just feels so satisfying. Tearing through waves of enemies as you perfectly time a parry, ending the foe with a kick to the face, it's a thing of fucking beauty.
I am genuinely impressed with how awesome all of this feels.

Finally, the game also passes with flying colors on most other aspects. It looks gorgeous, like every other RE Engine game, of course, but it also runs great, with me having literally no performance issues throughout almost 40 hours of gameplay since the start.
Not just that, but the story elements are also amazing. The characters are well done and overall pretty loveable, the story makes sense and forms an interesting tale, and it honestly just feels really good to see Leon as a more mature guy, with real training and experience in the field but still keeping his signature silliness and jokey personality. Also, everyone looks fucking gorgeous and it's kind of insane but no complaints here

Overall, I think RE4 does an amazing job improving on the gameplay mechanics and idea of RE2. It's a completely different game with a completely different feel that basically trades horror for action, but still has some pretty scary moments and DOES NOT dissapoint when it comes to things like enemy design and overall game visuals, which I think are PEAK in this game. Los Illuminados are a really interesting and fascinating cult and Las Plagas feel even more awesome than the G-Virus did, with us facing quite a lot of different enemies throughout the journey. It's an incredible game that I'll definetly be playing again for collectibles and achievements (and because it's fucking fun, let's get real here). Best Resident Evil I've played thus far.",True,Strategy

Out of all the remakes, this remake did the most justice to the OG. I do highly recommend to those who seek any replay value - main story, dlc and mercenaries mode where you can indulge in playing as some of the famous RE characters. Besides those positives, my main negative, kind of,  is the fact it cannot beat the unease charm RE 2R has, but on the other hand you can mod the game to custom difficulties, which can make it more of a survival game lol",True,Strategy

movement Leon does in the og mf was doing back flips and spins way to much for the movement he was doing it makes for a more realistic story my only complaint is they removed a achievement/way to end the beginning part early by shooting the bell xD but thats a very minor complaint I just found it funny that we could shoot the bell overall a worth while game Im hopeful we will get the spin off remakes soon",True,Strategy

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]PUBG – The Battle Royale That Started It All[/h1]

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★

PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

Survival & Tension: ★★★★★

Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆

While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.

Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆

KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.

Overall Verdict:

PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters.",True,Strategy

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"4/5

The original Battle Royale. PUBG's name will be echoed for generations as a cultural milestone that paved the way for all future BR's released to this day. What a wonderful game this was during its prime, little to no flaws in terms of performance and game mechanics. Every match is as stressful as it is rewarding. Unfortunately it just barely misses the perfect score for a few reasons. PUBG's downfall is one that should be studied by all future game developers. The reason for this downfall being BR's such as Fortnite and Apex at their peaks respectively. This wasn't because of quality or accessibility (Even though PUBG is notorious for poor performance on console.) but rather its price. PUBG did everything right, aside from removing that price tag sooner. The pride PUBG held for its lovechild was ultimately its downfall, with so many other free options, why convince friends to spend the thirty dollars on PUBG?

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"[h1]The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth – 10/10[/h1]

[h1]Introduction[/h1]

""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is a game that combines everything great about classic roguelikes while bringing something fresh and deep to the table. It’s one of those titles that draws you in for long hours, offering an immense variety and exceptional playability.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

The first thing that stands out is the dark yet hypnotic visual style. The pixel art is simple but perfectly matches the game’s atmosphere. Each level is packed with details that can evoke both fascination and unease. As time progresses, the visuals become more surreal, making the journey through this nightmare world even more intense.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay in ""Rebirth"" is a rollercoaster ride. The game offers an endless combination of procedurally generated levels, enemies, items, and challenges, making each experience unique. You play as Isaac, a boy who must navigate through the hell of his own mind, battling demons from his past and facing monsters in various dungeons. Every run feels like a journey through the unknown, full of surprises and emotions. If you’ve played classic roguelikes before, this game feels like home – no two runs are the same.

[h1]Items and Progression[/h1]

A fascinating aspect is the item system, where you can find different items during your run. Each item changes the way you play – some surprise you, some make the game easier, but others can lead to unexpected difficulties. This variety allows for many different combinations, making each playthrough feel new and fresh. It’s the magic of randomness, which never gets boring.

[h1]Difficulty and Challenge[/h1]

An essential part of the game is its difficulty. ""Rebirth"" can be brutal, but it’s this high level of challenge that keeps players coming back. It’s a title for those who aren’t afraid of failure and who have the motivation to try again, improving their skills with each attempt. Successes are incredibly satisfying, and failures teach you, shaping your approach for the next round.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]

The soundtrack is another highlight. It fits perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the game, building tension without overwhelming the player. The music sets the tone for intense gameplay, making every encounter feel more immersive and exciting.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

In conclusion, ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is a game that pulls you in and doesn’t let go. With tons of secrets, challenges, and surprises, it’s one of the best roguelikes out there. Tough, rewarding, and offering endless hours of gameplay. 10/10.",True,Strategy
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The definition of the genre of Roguelikes. This game is what every Roguelike enjoyer should have in their list.
Unlike Hades and Hades II, this game does not involve much story at all, but is gameplay-wise (in my opinion) at least 5 times more expansive than both the Hades series combined.
With each and every run being truly different and unique, this game delivers the most entertaining runs and playstyles within its category, and does not need to rely on fancy graphics nor an intriguing storyline to hook in players.

That being said however, this game is not really as straightforward as it seems or sounds. Many specific mechanics and special interactions have to be learned by the player as they slowly progress through the game's unlocks (It took me more than 100 hours to learn how to min-max every resource I am given). Do not worry, your patience is duly rewarded with what I describe as an enjoyably addictive experience.",True,Strategy
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Honestly, it's hard to truly recommend this game. But I do so anyways, because that's what it deserves.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is incredible, and while I would say it got even better with every DLC, I unfortunately cannot say that is the case. Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ are kind of... mediocre, to say the least...

But Repentance? The game becomes one of the best games in the roguelike dungeon crawler genre I've ever seen. Incredible room, enemy, and item variety, plenty of unlockable content and an incentive to use every character, and the best part of every version, no matter the dlc, is the possible item combinations you can find and (commonly) win with.

I start negative because of the fact that the $20 base game and the $60 dollar full DLC experience are vastly different when compared to each other, but if you do buy everything up to Repentance, it is SO WORTH the money.",True,Strategy
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"This game literally saves me from boredom. I never in my life was so much into the game but it changed with Isaac. Not too easy, not too hard, and doing unlocks is so much fun. I have played this game for almost 500 hours, and I have unlocked only half of the unlocks!!! Wish me luck, lmao.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"A legend among Roguelikes, and for over a decade now has maintained its' throne as one of the best examples of the genre -for good reason.

Isaac has of course inspired countless other games over the years -many of which have become hits in their own right, and yet it still feels fresh and fun to this day. This is a game that I'll happily dip into and play solidly for a couple of weeks, always delighted with how varied and fun the experience can be. After having unlocked another handful of achievements & items I'll usually drift away for a while to try something new. Or just dip into the library and revisit some other classics, only to find myself drawn back in a few months later. No regrets!

In terms of the actual gameplay, the twin stick controls are easy enough to pick up, and you'll feel right at home after your first few levels, although some of the mechanics may take a little time to click. But that's all part of the Roguelike learning experience. 

Speaking of things taking a little time, it's impressive just how much you will see the game change over your first few hours, with nearly every early run opening up new options. Beyond that are several layers of buried secrets to really sink your teeth into over the long term. 

We do of course have to briefly mention the huge variety of characters to unlock -who all play differently enough to really stand out and highlight different strategies you may never have thought of. Combine these with a seemingly endless variety of outlandish items and upgrades -nearly all of which synergize in some way -and you really never will have 2 identical runs.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Not much else to say about this game that hasn't been said before. A true cornerstone of the roguelike genre. Near flawless DLC expansions (Afterbirth+ being the sole exception, but is required to get to the cream of the crop, Repentance) which will greatly enhance your experience whilst playing.

[h1] Gameplay/Progression: 10/10 [/h1]
Difficult, but not impossible, with an insanely high skill-ceiling. All inputs being restricted to one of four cardinal directions leads to both simplistic gameplay and a huge amount of tech to learn (huge bonus if you don't have a decent mouse or are on a laptop). Casual players have more than enough of a challenge presented to them, but true die-hards will enjoy the fact that the game doesn't necessarily get ""easier"" the more you play it. Instead, the game's progression (and everyone's obsession with getting all 600+ achievements) forces you to adapt and consistently raises the bar of difficulty in an intriguing way each time you get comfortable (we don't talk about Ultra Hard). Wildly entertaining/interesting items and synergies lead to near endless experimentation and variety present in each run. Some items reference other media, some foreshadow the plot, and some are just plain creative. Characters can be either slight variations of the default or change the gameplay entirely, making the thought of the game ever getting ""stale"" seem impossible. Multiple difficulties and rugpulls lead to false senses of confidence; just when you think you can't get any better at the game, it introduces a new element or challenge to sit you right back down. Dangerously addictive and rewarding to progress/improve, even after hundreds or thousands of hours. Virtually bug-free, so there are very few ""unjustified"" deaths (a.k.a. skill-issue).

[h1] Visuals: 10/10 [/h1]
Sublime, basically perfect for a game in this genre. Models for characters, enemies, items, and environments are beautifully tied into the plot and hauntingly dark when needed. The artwork does an amazing job at appearing innocent upon first glance, but contains ludicrously intricate detail to remind the player of the dark themes present.

[h1] Plot: 11/10 [/h1]
If you have quite literally [i]any[/i] interest in or prior knowledge of biblical/religious themes, this game will absolutely blow your top off. Even if you don't, the meta-commentary is enough to carry the game on its shoulders. Without spoiling anything, it is clear that the creator (who has stated that the game is partially based on his childhood) has a deep, deep understanding of religious themes, references, and stories and uses his knowledge in a mind blowing fashion. If you have experienced any of the games core themes whilst you yourself were a child, the story will pull on your heartstrings ceaselessly.

[h1]Soundtrack/Sound Design: 10/10[/h1]
Mesmerizing. Not much to say besides it is very dynamic and reflective of what you are doing in the game. Builds tension when it has to, matches each environment perfectly.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a nearly flawless game. Barring a few questionable decisions by the creator (again, Ultra Hard), there is almost nothing negative to say about the game aside from the annoyance of needing to purchase a ""mid"" DLC (Afterbirth+) to play what is essentially ""The Binding of Isaac 2"" (but everyone and their mother has wrote home about this). So many elements come together to create a game that is mind-numbingly addictive, rewarding, and alluring--Just don't forget to check on your loved ones when you've been playing for 12 hours straight.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac is the holy grail of Roguelike games. This game essentially revolutionised the genre's placement in the modern gaming sphere and has held its place there for over a decade while getting large content releases that pad out the game even more.

It has a gameplay style similar to old Legend of Zelda overworlds. You walk around a top-down procedurally generated dungeon and collect money, items and trinkets to defeat the boss and continue exploring. The gameplay loop is based around replaying again and again. There is progression through the unlocking of new items, characters and other in-game content.

Ultimately, I think it's best to catagorize this as ""action solitaire"" in the sense of how you just walk again and again into different organizations of the same thing. Will probably still turn this on for a game or two for the next few decades.",True,Strategy

And even tho I got it on sale, I do genuinely believe this game plus DLC is worth the full price (for me at least. If I knew how much this game rocks I wouldn't have minded getting it before the sale).

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"It was originally a game of dungeon breakthrough rougelike. What I didn't know was that it was a Christian family. The child's mother was crazy to criticize his father for gambling on dogs. No one cared about the divorce. The child was wildly abused, stripped off his clothes, shut up in the room and refused to do anything. He was also chased by his mother with a kitchen knife. He had to escape into the underground room. He was tortured by flies and spiders. He ran deeper and deeper to meet all kinds of Cthulhu monsters. He had broken limbs, blood spattered, feces, urine, and urine. He was also addicted to drugs, needles, peeled, eyes, hanged, beheaded, blood drawn, and laparotomy. His mother flashed eyes against the sky with giant legs, jumped in the womb, suffocated, and decayed himself, as well as heaven and hell angels. The devil Satan Jesus finally went straight into insanity, turned into a crazy character, and came back to God to find that he could not escape in the box. He could only slowly suffocate with the dead cat. His skin turned blue, and the devil took off a lot of dung. Finally, he turned into a white bone.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"TLDR: Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (Including all the DLCs) is an EXTREMELY good game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good challenge.

There are so many things I wanna say about this game which all includes thoughts about items, bosses, achievements, etc. I really find the game enjoyable because it rely on you learning from failing. That can sound very harsh but the satisfaction you get shot straight to your brain when you on your 8th attempt finally beat that boss you have been struggling with is almost unmatched.
I find the difficulty just right so when you have done a good handful of runs you move like Neo through the early stages because you have learned the patterns.
The Items are plentiful and varies a lot in strength and synergy which makes it so that no run is ever the same despite you trying to make it so.
A single criticism I personally have is that despite you using 100 years playing this game completely blind you will never find every unlock because the are so out there. For a better experience (when you have a good handful of hours) I would recommend checking out the wiki-page for inspiration to what you can unlock next because there are way more unlocks then what it originally looks like which the game does very very little helping you figure out.
I have 100% the game (that being all the achievements on steam) and it can easily take a a seasoned player 400+ hours to do so. So if you goal is the 100% the game I say just ""buckle up buddy it is on hell of a ride""

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth with all of it's DLC is my favorite game ever created. I may have just over 300 hours on steam, but on the switch I have far over 2,000 hours. This review is primarily about the Repentance+ version of this game, which as of today is in version 1.9.7.10.
It's hard to think of where to begin with this game, so I'll just start with aesthetics to keep it simple. Upon first glance the game doesn't seem to be doing anything special, just a simple pixel style game, however seeing the transition from rebirth to repentance really makes you appreciate how far this game has come visually, from little things such as champion enemies being colored better, to more major improvements such as shaders and improved visual effects.
The real draw of this game comes from the sheer replayability. I have never played a game as replayable as The Binding of Isaac Repentance. 34 unique characters, hundreds of items, and so much variation from run to run. No single run is the same as any other run. Even after thousands of hours of playing this game there are synergies I have yet to see. Just recently I came across a synergy between ludovico and eye of the occult that I had never seen in my thousands of hours. and even if the game wasn't as replayable as it was, the game to this day, over a decade after its original release still receives so much developer support, only a few days ago the abyss item received dozens of new synergies in the form of unique locusts, not to mention the recent release of the Isaac online beta.
Before I get too deep into praising the game, this game is far from perfect. One problem I have is with poorly designed bosses and an occasional lack of enemy variety. Often bosses feel flimsily designed, either being too overwhelmingly powerful/unfair, or just boring/easy. most early game bosses are fairly well balances such as Monstro or Baby Plum, however certain bosses ruin the pool such as Rag Man, especially some of his self healing champion variants. Even late game we run into some issues with boss tuning. You have some well designed bosses with maybe 1 or 2 slightly unfair attacks such as Hush or Mega Satan, but there are as many well designed final bosses as there are poorly designed one's. ""???"" or ""Blue Baby"" is a complete pushover if you have an even slightly decent run, plus many of his attacks are just copy pasted from the Isaac fight, which is especially dissapointing when you consider not only how long this boss has existed without a rework, as well as the significance of the fight to the story of the game. And then of course there's Delirium, who is so poorly designed and unfair that you barely stand a chance fighting it unless you have a run that can instantly obliterate the boss in an instant. Sometimes he just teleports on top of you without a single warning, and when you have character's like the lost or the keeper who can die in just two hits, that can become a real problem. Another problem that come's with the final bosses is how commonly you'll decide to see each one. As you're hunting for achievements, it won't be uncommon to run into bosses such as The Beast and Mother, however once your post-its are full, there is little to no reason to seek those bosses out, which is a real shame because they're among some of the most well designed bosses in the game, I wish these parts of the Repentance DLC were better intertwined with the routes you can take in the base game. 
I could complain about this game for ages despite my love for it, so in order to not drag out this review much further I'm gonna go through a speed round of complaints, ready, here we go. Some characters aren't very fun and have little replay value, some challenges (such as ultrahard) are completely unfun, certain items can be completely run ruining if you pick them up by mistake, greedier mode just sucks, the void floor is not fun as it has little to no original rooms, simply stealing rooms from other floors, some characters are a little overpowered.
Despite my complaints on the game, my praise far outweighs any problems I may have, and you could argue all these problems are easily solvable, not only due to the constant developer support, but with the immense variety and ease of modding tools. The creative potential people have when modding this game rivals the likes of games such as Terraria, so if I have a problem with the bosses, I can just use the reworked bosses mod, if i have a problem with enemy variety, I can just install Fiend Folio, the sky really is the limit when it comes to modding this game.

It has soooo many things to unlock for the completionists and plenty of well done fan-made add ons. It has bosses and items that can be equally silly (a cute-faced boss poo) and disgusting (defeating a fetus in your mother's womb). You can basically dictate how difficult you want your runs to go by which character you chose (you will have to unlock more outside of Isaac through playing) and which decisions you make by what floors you chose to do (going out of your way to get to Mines) and what bosses (picking Sheol or Cathedral, or Blue Baby over Satan).

Titanfall® 2,"(I have several more hours of gameplay on the console version.) Plays perfectly on the Steam Deck. Community is still thriving! The multiplayer is fast and exciting because of it's fluid movement (wall running, double-jumping, sliding, etc) and solid gunplay. It's similar to the vertical/twitchy Call of Duty titles, but there is giant mech combat thrown into the mix!

In conclusion if you're purely buying it for the campaign go ahead it's lots of fun but I'd recommend you buy it on sale since it is a little short. The weapons are nice and smooth to use and the movement is fun to mess around with. And the visuals were really pretty for a 2016 game. If you're buying it for both campaign and multiplayer or 100% purposes be ready to mess with your PC system commands a bit.,True,Strategy

In the campaign you play the role of a pilot, skilled in combat and weapons.  You can also call in a mech (Titan) to help with a battle, jump inside and use the weapons from the Titan to cause some serious damage.

Controls work perfectly, graphics look great and it's a lot of fun.  Wall-running is a nice touch, you will need those skills to escape from certain areas or to survive multiple attacks, it also helps to progress in the campaign as some areas will need a little thought before advancing.

You will pick up better Titans as you move through the campaign, each one with a unique set of skills.

Highly recommended for fans of FPS and immersive/innovative AAA game design.  8.5/10,True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"Titanfall 2 nowadays an old game but back then a real classic and fun game.

Typical first person shooter which feels very smooth and good, this shooter is well optimized and i only had good experience in it. If you reach a certain amount of kills you can get into your Titan and fight against other Titans.
Maps are well designed and fun to play.

Give it a try, even today it's still a banger.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"its sad to see the developers abandoned the franchise . Man titanfall was and is one of the best fps games , and titanfall 2 is just perfect both in campaign and multiplayer.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"A sci-fi FPS game that makes you feel like you’re in a Neill Blomkamp movie (think District 9, Elysium). 

It has beautiful graphics, mechs (Titans), parkour with wall running and double jumps, interesting level design in the campaign that requires those moves and of course there’s a fully developed multiplayer mode. Sci-fi weapons you use follow the usual tropes only partially, there are some really original ones, especially when you’re driving a Titan.

Gameplay is a constant shift between controlling the pilot (human soldier) and a Titan. Pilots are more agile, they can do all the aforementioned parkour moves while playing as a Titan feels like playing a Transformers FPS game. If I were to compare the game to cinematic experiences again, I would say it’s a mix between Neill Blomkamp and Michael Bay movies in the best possible sense.

The campaign is short, the story is not too deep but is entertaining and funny enough to give context for all the visually impressive action that you must engage in. Presentation is really impressive. When it comes to the way the game's story is told, sometimes you are given dialogue options when talking to your Titan partner BT. The animated executions whether you’re playing as a Titan or a pilot also add to the cinematic feel of the whole experience. 

Overall, the game is a good example of what a first person shooter should be and if you like sci-fi action games like Halo, Doom, Half-Life, Unreal Tournament, Terminator: Resistance and other titles of this sort, Titanfall 2 is a must play for you.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,One of my favorite innovative games of the century. It's a shame that the multiplayer is filled with a bunch of sweats. The campaign though has a got a decent story too. Be sure to get this on sale. It typically goes for about $5 during that time.,True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"Probably the best FPS I've ever played. Second best campaign I've ever played, only topped by Halo: Reach. I love this game. Would recommend 11/10.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,Fun gunplay and great short story. Makes me want to go back and play Apex Legends again. Glad I got this experience.,True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"My favourite campaign (and game) yet. I really wish they would come out with a Titanfall 3 but I know most of their effort has been going into Apex, which is fun too however Titanfall had an unexpectedly well written storyline which progressed into an unexpected emotional connection to the protagonist Titan ""BT"".  Yes there's lots of blowing things up however there's a genuine sense of safety when your Titan is nearby vs if you were to be split apart.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,I had so much fun playing this game for the first time. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of respawn - or action games for that matter. What a blast hopefully one day we'll get a sequel!,True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"Keep coming back to this since 2019 (thank you ps plus). Both campaign and multiplayer are fun, takes a while for multiplayer matches depending on what time i play but matches are worth the wait cause the lobbies are decent 98% of the time.

Titanfall® 2,"The story is very well written and really meant something.
The multiplayer is very fast paced and smooth.
Worth to buy even of sale. 
Highly recommend this game.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"I played it through to G7 or 8 on Xbox one and series s, now bought again and playing on pc.
This game has staying power, maybe more than battlefield one, which was released at the same time and overshadowed it thanks to stupid decisions by EA. They had two epic games come out at the same time but didn’t give this one the pedestal it deserved.
It should have been released months later or earlier. 
I bought every skin and dlc on the console, just to show them love for all the time I had in the game. Fluidity. Epic battles, intense game modes. Customization to a decent amount, 
This game is worth your time, and I haven’t seen one match it for solidness in the fps arena.
It is worth fourty bucks just for the campaign, and worth twice that for the multiplayer. 
The online is still alive, lots of people play this consistently.
Devs should all be looking at this game as an example of good production, execution and respect for the players.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"Short, sweet, simple shooter fun. I initially played this however many years ago and completed the campaign. Went back recently to go through the game as I kept reading how good the single player campaign is.

After revisiting it, I'd say it's not bad. It's fun and unique and has enough interesting situations that it kept me entertained for about 5 hours. There's time travel and jumping and interesting traversal mechanics that continually keep things fresh. At least for about 5 or 6 hours. I think if it went much longer it'd start to feel repetitive. 

I guess my biggest complaints are that all the guns feel roughly the same. It doesn't really matter which gun you shoot with, they all seem to have the same weight and feel. 

Oh, it's also impressive it ran on SteamDeck at 90fps for almost the entire game. Anyways, I don't think it was mind blowing, but it was fun enough for $5.

Titanfall® 2,"At first, I didn’t believe it. Titanfall 3 was impossible. It couldn’t be real. It had to be some kind of hallucination, a dream, a flicker of some long-buried wish. I kept telling myself that—over and over, like a mantra. But as I kept playing, something started to feel... wrong.

It wasn’t just the game. No, the game wasn’t the problem. Something else was tugging at the edges of my thoughts, just out of reach. I tried to ignore it, but the harder I tried, the more it crept in. The Titans weren’t just on my screen anymore. They were... with me. Watching me. I felt their weight in my chest, their presence pressing against the back of my mind like they were trying to break through.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Titanfall 2 was the last one. I knew it. They told us. But no. No, this wasn’t over. Titanfall 3 wasn’t some distant hope. It was already here, and I had to accept it. Even though I couldn’t remember when it started. I didn’t want to remember. The moment I called in that Titan... it wasn’t just a game anymore.

I don’t know when I stopped playing and when it became real. The lines blurred. The Titans—I could hear them, feel them in the air. The ground under my feet trembled like I was still in the match. No, not just in the match—in the fight. I felt it in my bones. Every time I dropped, every time I ran, it was like I was crossing over, stepping deeper into it. Into the game. But it wasn’t a game anymore. Was it?

I kept playing. It had to be real. I wasn’t going crazy. I wasn’t.

But then... I began to forget. Forget...? No, that’s not it. I couldn’t remember things anymore. The walls felt different. The shadows—they weren’t just shadows. They were watching me. They were waiting. The Titans. They were always there. Always. They followed me, even when I wasn’t playing. I couldn’t escape. Couldn’t escape the feeling of being watched.

It wasn’t the game. It never was the game. I think I’ve known that for a while now. The Titans are here. Not in the game. Not in the code. They’re inside me. They’re inside this house. Inside my mind.

I tried to leave. I really did. I tried to quit, to shut it off. But it was already too late. When I closed my eyes, I saw them. Their red eyes. Their massive feet shaking the ground beneath me. I wasn’t playing anymore. The world was playing me. I was just... part of it.

And then it hit me. The drop. The fight. It wasn’t just a part of the game. It was the test. Every time I thought I was done, I was only falling deeper. I kept trying to break free, but the Titans kept coming. Not just in the game—no, in my thoughts. In my very soul. I think I’m still in it. I think I always will be.

The worst part? I thought I was the one controlling it. I thought I was the one playing the game. But it wasn’t me. It never was.

I’ve been running from this for so long. But there’s no escape. I don’t know where the game ends and I begin.

I searched for Titanfall 3. I searched for something to pull me out. Something to make sense of it all. But the truth is... Titanfall 3 was always here. Always has been. It’s not something I can see on a screen anymore. It’s inside me. It’s in everything. It’s in you.

Titanfall 3 is real. It always was.",True,Strategy

Titanfall® 2,I don't like arcade movement shooters... but this one is different and worth its price already for the campaign only. Multiplayer being able to switch from foot to titan means action and tactics on a whole new level. Underrated game and easily worth playing in 2025.,True,Strategy

I liked the story and the Pilot/Titan bond. The FPS plays very well, no wonder this was used for Apex Legends. My only minor gripe is the gameplay inside the Titan, I didn't really enjoy it, but you don't need to use it very often.

Titanfall® 2,"This game is regularly on sale for $2.99, so there is no reason to buy it at the $29.99 full price 

I purchased and played Titanfall 2 in 2025, and at the $2.99 price, it really is worth picking up. The campaign takes about 6 hours and I enjoyed almost every aspect of it. The only thing I disliked is some of platforming is a little clunky.

The story was just middle of the road, but it was carried by likeable characters and interactions between you and your titan. Gunplay is solid - I really enjoyed how being in the mech made you feel tanky and powerful. While being boots on the ground felt a bit more vulnerable. As it should be. 

I did not mess with the online. I imagine it would be difficult with veterans playing it for years - although I commend it for still being available to play if that interests you. 

No issues running the game on my steam deck and the achievements unlock even when offline mode - which is appreciated because not all games do this.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"Titanfall 2 is an amazing game definitely worth it’s full price. The story is short (five hours or so) but sweet, and connects story with game-play seamlessly to create a wonderful adventure full of unique levels. The multiplayer is probably just as good as the story. You fight with (or without) a titan and try to dominate the battlefield or capture an objective. It has a fast paced feel and never fails to excite me, no matter the mode. The customization of your character allows you to have completely different play styles and tactics. Overall, Titanfall 2 is an unforgettable game with unique characteristics and game play.",True,Strategy
Titanfall® 2,"One of the best single player campaigns I have ever played and the MP is solid as well. I pray that Respawn can carry all the good elements of Titanfall 2 into Titanfall 3 and make that game even better, when and if they ever make it.",True,Strategy

",True,Strategy
Planet Coaster,"Chris Sawyer paved the way for the theme park simulation genre back in 1999 with Rollercoaster Tycoon and followed it up in 2002, both of which became classics in gaming and ended up creating an entire genre of video games. Since then, Frontier have taken up the mantle, gaining the rights to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series with RCT3 and later entries. While these sequels were pretty meh, Frontier has tried to revive the genre with Planet Coaster.

This was an incredible attempt to modernise the theme park sim genre for new audiences, and for the most part they met this challenge admirably. The game is packed with charm, creativity and is a satisfying simulation of theme park management. The building tools are excellent, coaster physics are top notch, the level of creativity you can accomplish is unmatched by anything else in the genre.

Recently Planet Coaster 2 has come out, and if you're trying to decide which is worth buying, it's this one. This game is magical, it's a truly brilliant revival of a lost genre. Frontier in the past struggled to understand what made Sawyer's RCT games special. With Planet Coaster 2 they've made the same mistake, where they struck gold in Planet Coaster 1 they've misunderstood what made this game special. It's a disappointment to see Frontier return to old habits after coming so close to perfection with this game.",True,Strategy

Planet Coaster,"Step 1: The Excited Architect
You start with a blank park, full of possibilities. You begin building a roller coaster of your dreams, thinking this is going to be the best theme park ever.

Step 2: The First Disaster
You overestimate your skills, make a coaster so steep it flings riders into space. Guests start to complain, but you convince yourself it's part of the ""experience.""

Step 3: The Concessions Crisis
People are hungry, but you can’t figure out how to build a food stand that doesn’t end up charging $50 for a soda. Guests are mad, but they’re too busy screaming on the coaster.

Step 4: The Construction Nightmare
You spend hours perfecting the coaster, only to realise your paths are all over the place and guests are stuck wandering aimlessly, trapped in a labyrinth of poor design.

Step 5: The Roller coaster Carnage
You finally get a ride to work, but it’s so intense people start passing out. You consider this a success because they still pay for tickets.

Step 6: The Realisation
By now, your park is a disaster, with people flying off rides, crying about food, and wondering why they ever came here. But you keep building—because, hey, it’s your dream park, right?

Step 7: The Cycle of Destruction
You realise you’ve spent 5 hours on a park that’s basically a death trap and yet… you can’t stop. You’re addicted. You start building bigger, crazier coasters. You’ll fix the park later… maybe.",True,Strategy

Planet Coaster,"There's a certain je nai ses quoi that Planet Coaster lacks, compared to the former titan of the genre Roller Coaster Tycoon. It doesn't even have the jennies of other tycoon games, instead feeling more like a diorama builder with a management game stapled onto the side. 

I like'd like more numbers and a less cumbersome UI, but I don't think this game was made for me. If your special interest is themeparks or rollercoasters, you'll probably have a much better time with this game than I've had.",False,Strategy

Positives
+ Gameplay is still very much the same as the original - there are no major overhauls of the core mechanics which made previous renditions great
+ Improved resource UI which makes villager management much easier during the crucial first minutes of the game
+ The ability to queue both units and technologies simultaneously
+ The ability to indefinitely re-seed farms and fish traps if you have the available resources
+ Several new units and technologies (such as the Steppe Lancer and Supplies) to balance existing civilisations and provide new ways to play
+ Multiple new single-player / multi-player lobby options, such as game speed, map pool, AI difficulty and type (such as the 'new' AI for Definitive Edition, or the HD and CD AI)
+ You can use the lobby browser for multi-player while waiting in a lobby
+ Your multi-player game stats are tracked, and you can earn player profile pictures from time played, number of victories etc.
+ Improved visual effects (such as collapsing structures, improved unit models and environmental / lighting effects)
+ Improved sound effects, whilst remaining true to the charm of classic Age of Empires II (units have their original voice lines and so on)
+ Massive update to AI commanding in single player games - you can now use the taunt/command system to tell your AI allies to train specific types of units, construct buildings on a flare marker, attack a specific target and so on
+ Several new civilisations with their own unique units
+ Several new historical campaigns
+ Massive improvement to the tutorial system, with new scenarios (Art of War) specifically catered to helping new players deal with managing economies, performing and defending from rushing, etc.
+ Tweaks to the scenario editor (such as copy-pasting event triggers)
+ In-house mod support (Steam workshop has been removed in favour, could be interpreted as a negative)
+ Xbox LIVE profile support and cross-play
+ A ton of different settings to customise your gameplay experience by tweaking controls, graphics, sound and so on (several of these settings also make the game more accessible for individuals experiencing difficulty from handicaps such as colour blindness etc.)
+ Dedicated servers, and private multi-player games appear to run much smoother than HD
+ Steam achievements and trading cards
+ Improved replays and save systems (you can save 'chapters' in a replay for players to watch specific events)

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,"After playing more than 2000 hours since the definite edition came out i might write a recommendation.
I knew the AOE-Franchise from my childhood but i didnt touch the game in 15 years. 
THe new definitve edition and a friend of mine brought me back to the game and after a stresful learning curve i have to say its worth the time. im speaking mainly from a competitive player perspective in pvp. compared to other rts macro and strategy are more important than just microing the units. graphics are very nice, even better than aoe4 when you talk about visibility and clearnes for pvp-play. best thing is, the global community is really nice, nothing in comparison to LoL, cs or other big pvp-online-games. 
also you can find lot of content on twitch and youtube. i recommend t90official and spiritofthelaw for a start. 

one last note to the ranking-system: for beginners i highly recommend to play some pve first but then dont be afraid to start in the ranking-matches and skip the normal game-mod in pvp. yes you will lose the first 10-20 games, but the elo-system will give you fitting opponents after that. smurf-accounts may occur but should be a rarity in age. 
when you play normal-pvp ""quickplay"" the difference between players skill can vary alot. so as a beginner: just dont do that. 

if your not into competitive rts the game propably still is way worth the money. there is alot alot alot (!) of campaign-content when you buy the full game-package. with the difficulty on easy you can also enjoy the storylines and dont have to sweat to hard. :-) and just by the way you can play aoe1 within the aoe2-game. 

we love this game",True,Strategy
Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,"Best strategy game of all time!!!! Definitely pick up if you like strategy games, and actually isn't too expensive.

Thanks to mods, the game is way more oversee-able from a bird's-eye view, and it has a less cartoony, more old-school aesthetic. The buildings snap into place smoothly, and hotkeys are essential—gotta love the auto-scout feature!

Overall, this version is much better than the original Age of Empires 2 and works really well, running optimally. If you're after some nostalgia or want to dive into something more competitive with a clearer overview compared to Age of Empires 4, this game is definitely worth checking out.",True,Strategy
Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,Love playing this game but now that you can't play it offline it's off my list entirely.

I really don’t like how long matches can get, and I dislike how you ""lose"" your progress when a game or campaign ends, as you can’t continue once it’s finished.

Some campaign missions are, in my opinion, very difficult to beat. I spent over six hours trying to complete The Rising - Joan of Arc.

If you're patient and don’t mind losing, this game is for you. If you don't want to sit down after a stressful day and add even more stress, this game is not for you.

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition (AoE2: DE) 

Can significantly improve your cognitive abilities in various ways:

1. Strategic Thinking & Decision-Making
You need to plan economy, military, and expansion strategies in real time.
Balancing resources, army composition, and scouting opponents enhances long-term thinking.

2. Multitasking & Time Management
Managing villagers, military production, and battles simultaneously sharpens multitasking.
Prioritizing tasks (e.g., booming economy vs. early aggression) improves time efficiency.

3. Problem-Solving & Adaptability
Adjusting strategies based on enemy tactics teaches flexible problem-solving.
Countering different civilizations and strategies improves analytical thinking.

4. Memory & Information Processing
Remembering civilization bonuses, unit counters, and build orders enhances memory retention.
Quickly interpreting map layouts and opponent movements sharpens pattern recognition.

5. Hand-Eye Coordination & Reflexes
Fast-paced micromanagement during battles improves coordination and reaction speed.
Hotkeys and rapid decision execution boost motor skills.

6. Patience & Mental Endurance
Longer matches require sustained focus, boosting concentration and endurance.
Losing and learning from mistakes enhances resilience and adaptability.

7. Teamwork & Communication (if playing multiplayer)
Coordinating with teammates improves leadership and cooperative skills.
Understanding roles in team games helps with delegation and strategy execution.

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,"This edition has good graphics, and the expansions are cool. However I think the HD edition is better simply due to the AI issues.   AoE2 is probably the most popular AoE game, and for good reason. The campaigns are quite well written and extensive (hours and hours of gameplay now) and the multiplayer is great for competition. 

However, the biggest downside with this particular edition is its really inconsistent AI. The Campaign AI on Moderate can be either super easy or *brutally* difficult, and the trend applied to Skirmish maps too. For example, I played one match where the AI boomed and built a huge ~200 pop army with seemingly infinite resources, and it sent that army at me in one giant swarm, a constant barrage of units... and every game since then it never built more than 40 villagers, never boomed.

Beat Saber,"Once you're done with the tutorial, the game is ONLY good with mods! While it costs $2 per DLC song from the official developers, there are tens of thousands of community made maps that are FREE! Plus way cooler effects, sounds and visuals than base game... and community made maps actually have good flow. The majority of the free official songs are mapped in a way that just feels... not as good... once you start playing the community maps.",True,Strategy
Beat Saber,"Great game. This is THE VR rhythm game. without a doubt. This is the only reason I bought a VR headset and This is the only game I ever come back to.

I just wish the mods didn't break EVERY SINGLE PATCH.

This game does get you really tired and sweaty if you're playing the higher difficulty maps though. so just a heads up!",True,Strategy
Beat Saber,"If you use a Quest save yourself the trouble and buy this very cool game on the Meta store to avoid potentially significant performance issues...

I've tried about 30 different things to get rid of the infamous micro-stutters from Steam Link / SteamVR via WiFi. My WiFi can keep up and I know this from monitoring the real-time transfer rate. It's very obvious when stutters happen as the rate drops to nearly 0 for a split second then comes right back up and maintains a solid 280-300 mpbs; the router can go higher than that. My GPU is RTX 4070 SUPER. A ton of locations have reported this as an issue with SteamVR as of a more recent-ish update that remains unresolved.

I changed various settings within SteamVR and got the stutters significantly reduced but once you start playing on Expert and want to get SS grade performance, the blocks are going by fast enough that 1 stutter completely removes your ability to hit a block even if you're doing the correct hand motions, which is super frustrating.

Avoiding SteamVR is the way to go here unless you can run via cable, maybe then the stutters won't happen.

Beatsaber is 10/10, but not when delivered via Steam. There's also naturally no cross-buy (e.g. if I want to play it directly from the Quest headset I have to buy it again on the Meta store).",False,Strategy

Ill start this off by saying I personally played this on the Quest 2 which worked great for what I wanted out of beat saber, however there is definitely more available with more equipment. Beat Sabers's standard catalog is fine, there is a good selection however the community created modded tracks definitely help Beat saber shine. The game is pretty fluid and honestly ends up being a great exercise  to get you moving, whilst also being an enjoyable time. Id definitely recommend this for anyone with a want for more VR games in their catalog.

Beat Saber,"yes yes you NEED to play this game!! if you haven't played this game, DO IT.
I enjoy this game so much, it is very easy to play. if you are prone to get the piano games or any of the rhythm games on your phone, you should give this game a try. It takes it to another level and so much fun. i think for the game only being $20 is such a good price since you get unlimited game play. I download music so i can play whatever songs i want on the game. The downloaded music as a good selection and you normally can find whatever songs you are wanting in the difficulty you need. There are a lot of expert songs so the more you get better the more songs you will be able to play. But please play if you have not!",True,Strategy
Beat Saber,"Arguably one of the best Rhythm games that happens to be VR that gets more and more frustrating and annoying to play as you delve into it. 
The core game play is solid and enjoyable, not much can go wrong with cutting blocks in half with laser swords to a good rhythm. This however leads to the first of my many issues with the game.
Of the core songs, which there are seven volumes and an ""extra"" pack with remixes on some songs in said volumes, I would say maybe.... half at best are actually enjoyable to play. The designs of the beat tracks in a lot of the songs seem to not have been designed in a way that answers ""what is an enjoyable rhythm and flow that the player can get into?"" but instead ""how can we make this song 'unique' by adding obtuse and annoying flows and physically awkward ways the player has to contort themselves?""
Next major issue is the complete lack of internal consistency in the difficulty selection for each song, an expert level on one can easily be the same level as a normal or even easy song just one song lower in the list. This leads to picking songs to play that you aren't completely familiar with a pain as you have to try and figure out how difficult a song is not by it's listed difficulty but by the other stats that you are shown e.g blocks per second etc. This combined with the previously mentioned issue in returns to beatmap design being a crapshoot on first try can lead to you being completely ambushed by a songs difficulty and failing within the first 30 seconds on something you'd reasonably expect to complete based on the difficulty you selected: this is not fun for hopefully obvious reasons.
Final major issue is the DLC song situation and how pushed updates break all mods for this game every time a DLC is published. My major issue with the DLCs is two fold, firstly is that there is no way to try out a song first to see if it's actually enjoyable. This is a big deal as Beat Saber by this point has shown that it's a coin flip at best whether a song, from a rhythm game perspective, will even be fun to play. Second issue with DLCs is that the updates they come with, that you can't avoid installing if you want to play the game, will break all mods you are using and potentially relying on to make the game more usable or adding more content.

Final words/TLDR: Beat Saber is an excellent rythm game with no real competitors in the VR space but it's many issues outside the core game of slicing stuff with laser swords and the poor and unfun design of nearly half or more of the core songs you have in the base game means I can't give this a recommend at this time.",False,Strategy
Beat Saber, good game. directions> slice block music color arrow,True,Strategy

Beat Saber,Any game that also acts as exercise is a win win and Beat Saber is a very fun game.

Beat Saber,"Genuinely my favourite VR game but probably not worth it if you don't plan on modding unless there is a DLC pack that you really want to play as a rhythm game. 

The base songs aren't terrible but not what I'd be wanting to spend dozens of hours playing/listing to. The single player campaign gets brutally difficult in ways that I find pointless. For example the current one i'm stuck on is to get no less than 32 combo but no more than 34 and honestly I'll never pass it because it's just not worth the effort. 

There is a big modding community however that let you import hundreds of songs and that's where the fun is at.",True,Strategy

I immediately went online and learned how I could play this fantastic game at home and thus began my VR journey and moreso my longterm relationship with Beat Saber. I would play every day, several times a day, and when lying in bed I would see blocks moving toward me and hear rhythms. And years later, it's still my most played game.

for a 2015 game its criminal that this outperformed and outsold some other games in the market specially while being a 20€ game with no dlc, you buy it and that's it, one of the best games.
I literally got into this game because of the banger soundtrack and holy crap it was one of the best decisions I have made.
A friend of mine got into the yakuza series because I sent him a video about disco queen, since then he played 0,kiwami,kiwami2,3,4,5,6 and 7 and will play gaiden soon.

Yakuza 0,"Yakuza 0 is the 6th main entry in Sega's long-running series of the same name and chronologically takes place before every other canonical entry, being set in 1988. (about 7 years before the prologue of the original game and 17 years before most of its' story takes place)

Many people have, and will likely continue to use this game as a starting point for the series because of the above mentioned, and I wholeheartedly agree. With one of the best stories in the series, some of the best combat of the main games and two separate characters with 8 fighting styles between them, tons of other depth commonplace with this franchise and graphics that still hold up incredibly well (especially for a late PS3/early PS4 title) this game hits so many highs time after time that I simply cannot recommend it enough.

The gameplay is engaging, especialy Majima's Breaker style. The minigames within the main game are probably one of the best I've ever seen. Really puts even GTA to shame with way less budget. And the story is actual cinema. The only pet peeves are lack of proper open world/size of the location (doesnt let you vibe in it as good as it could have been), lack of voiceacting in substories(though understandable, again, the budget), and the fact that they do get a bit bloated in its amount, and start to fall down by the second half of the game (love stories are good, but not when every quest in second half starts to be them, especially compared to how good they were in the first half)

Yakuza 0,"When I first bought yakuza, I thought it was gonna be some goofy, silly little game that everybody's soul on earth loved, but it's far better than that. There are so many things that are good about this game that I never knew even came from this game and it really made my experience with the game 1000x more better.

This game was not anything I had expected and the story is absolutely scintillating but at the same time extraordinarily sad. The story is so well-put together and is by far one of the greatest story-rich games anyone could ever grace their hands upon, and don't even get me started on the characters, because you have 2 badass main characters, Kiryu and Majima, who both have very depressing and disturbing backstories, and the character development they both had throughout this game is magnificent, unlike anything I've ever seen in any game I've played, and then you have the 3 Dojima family lieutenants: Kuze, Awano and Shibusawa. Kuze is pretty much a pain throughout the game towards Kiryu, however Awano and Shibusawa are pretty chill and cool, I like them. Then you have characters such as Sagawa, who is literally keeping Majima in Sotenbori like he's a caged animal up until the last few chapters of the game. All of the voice acting in this game is stupendous as well and it sometimes creates a truly horrific atmosphere, for example like when Tachibana was being tortured by the Dojima, the voice acting truly hit deep at that point.

Although this game has a very deep meaning into the life of a yakuza and has a very sad story, there are many things that you can do throughout the game that are so random that it just makes that game so goofy and silly. Things like singing bakamitai or 24 hour Cinderella with the brilliant visuals in the background, watching sexy videos, doing the hustle, running your own cabaret club or real estate agency to unlock new fighting styles, pocket racing or even calling random women in the most dramatic fashion imaginable. All of this can be randomly discovered throughout the game and it really lightens up the mood.

At times, there are stunning cutscenes during the game that truly highlight a dramatic moment within the story, and although most of the time these cutscenes don't usually show a good change in the story, they still give an undoubtedly exhilarating experience for the player and sometimes even gets the player to figure out why certain characters are doing what they are doing. For example, this happened to me when I was in a cutscene with Tachinbana in Little Asia, and when he tells Kiryu that Makimura is the owner of the empty lot, that was when I realised why everyone was attempting to kill her. It just made the experience have much more shock factor to it and it made it so much better to play through.

This is likely my only serious review I have for a game, and this is purely because this game is actually insane. Yakuza 0 is actually such a good game I would recommend it to a newborn baby who is just fresh out the womb. In my opinion, this is my new favourite game, it will go at #1 on my top 10 games of all time. This game 100% without a doubt gets a 10/10 from me. I will soon be playing the rest of the yakuza series and I hope all of them will be just as good as yakuza 0 (Btw if I said something wrong about the main story of this game in this review, my fault gang).",True,Strategy

Yakuza 0,"I don't often write proper game reviews, but i recently finished this game for the first time and i just wanted to talk about how amazing and incredible it was for me. Rating this 10/10 would be an under exaggeration.

At the time of writing, I have only very recently gotten into the Like a Dragon series, and Yakuza 0 is the first of that series that I have played. Even without knowing a thing about the story or the characters, I was immediately hooked and became attached to every character that showed up on my screen, every one of them were so easy to love and I wanted to keep playing for hours at a time just to see what would happen to them.

I would become so invested into the main story that I would almost completely ignore the entire subplots that are in this game. The amount of sub stories that are scattered about is insane, and each of them were perfectly balanced with humour and emotion and some of the NPCs absolutely stole my heart. The contrast between the main story and the side plots is so hilariously perfect and the game manages to change the tone with the filp of a switch and have it still feel completely natural.

The minigames are also amazing. I am not the most skilful at any game, but the mechanics for all the minigames are luckily very simple and easy to understand plus the tutorials were a huge help for me. I love how different minigames have their own sub stories attached to them and it kept it really entertaining and gave me a good reason to go back and play some of the ones that I wasn't immediately interested in. The disco was a personal favourite of mine.

Speaking of, the soundtrack in this game is so so so good, I've been listening to it constantly on my train journeys I wont even try to deny it. It does such a good job for setting the tone for the different cut scenes and it did a great job at moving me to tears at times. The music for all the different fighting styles is just so perfect and they really making you feel so cool while you're hitting combos. I personally enjoyed Majima's fighting music over Kiryu's but they are both so amazing and reflect both characters styles perfectly.

The combat in this game is the most addictive thing ever. Like I said, I'm not the most skilled when it comes to video games, but the combat system in this game was explained so perfectly that I was able to get the hang of it after the first hourish of gameplay. I will never get over that feeling of beating the crap out of people and having them explode with money. The level up system is also amazing, since money is endless it makes sense that that'd be the way to improve your punching abilities. It felt so good to try out new moves you unlocked in the main story.

The atmosphere and environment is SO amazing and immersive. I would get lost in the city for several real life hours just looking around every little corner and just taking in the life of the city. The ambience is great and you can really get lost in the world that these characters live in. The abundance of NPCs everywhere also really helps give the bustling city energy and I love the constant encounters that are waiting down every street.

I'v had so much fun playing this game and I definitely would love to try and 100% it at some point. I cried so hard when i finished the game and I've genuinely had such a blast. I would highly recommend Yakuza 0 to anyone who likes fighting games, story games, or just video games in general. I cannot wait to play through the rest of this series and I hope that I'm able to fix my sleep schedule now I've completed this game.

Yakuza 0,"[h1]Sights & Sounds[/h1]
[h3]Pleased to meet you[/h3]
[list]
[*] First impressions are undebatably important. No, I don't mean the intro cutscene; those can be impressive, but most AAA titles start off with those. [i]Yakuza 0[/i]'s is fine, but it's not going to do more beyond set up some important characters, events, and locations. I'm talking about when you first gain control of your character and can start playing the game
[*] [i]Yakuza 0[/i] plants you in a crowded, neon-washed sidestreet littered with NPCs, grime, and activity. It's the 80's. It's Tokyo. You've just beaten the piss out of some deadbeat gullible or desparate enough to fall into debt for a loan shark and you're looking to wind down with your best friend and sworn brother. You push your way through the crowds under the thrum of a thousand conversations and the chorus of pachinko machines
[*] Presentation is something that other open world games often get wrong. There isn't anything fun about running through a basically featureless jungle or grassland to chase map icons. It's even less appealing if you replace the greenery with the ocean and add a boat (looking at you, [i]Assassin's Creed[/i]). Even titles that give you a fleshed out urban setting like those in the [i]GTA[/i] franchise fumble the tone a bit by making all ambient NPC banter boil down to crime, drugs, and double entendres
[*] From that description, you probably gathered that the sound design is pretty good. I played with Japanese voice acting and subtitles, and the voice acting seems quite good as well, especially villains Kuze, Awano, and Sagawa. However, I don't speak Japanese, so my opinion may be unqualified
[*] The soundtrack is an exciting blend of raucous electronic music paired with a few tracks of solo-driven heavy metal guitar wankery. Oh, and Jpop, can't forget about that. Of course there's karaoke in the game, and getting to hear some era-appropriate music was nice. I just wish that the rest of the OST would have taken cues from that choice; hearing the contemporary-sounding battle theme ramp up as a group of hooligans runs at you sort of takes you out of your 80s headspace
[/list]

[h1]Story & Vibes[/h1]
[h3]Starting off with a bang[/h3]
[list]
[*] A lot of what I said above about first impressions? It carries right over to the narrative as well. [i]Yakuza 0[/i]'s opening chapter is a hell of an intro to the story. You assume the role of Kiryu, a yakuza underling trying to climb the ranks of the ruthless Dojima family. The syndicate, composed of several different competing and cooperating crime families, has seized nearly complete control over Kamurocho's real estate except for one tiny exception: a tucked-away empty lot
[*] The plan is simple: control the lot to control the district, then bundle the land and sell it for a mint. Except, there's a couple of issues. First, no one knows who owns the lot, so the family doesn't know who needs to be intimidated, bribed, or killed in order to sieze the claim. Second, delivering this parcel to the head of the Dojima family virtually guarantees shooting to the top of the syndicate's pecking order, so competition is fierce. Finally, a new ruthless real estate firm who seems to be aware of the scheme has moved into town and appears to have designs on thwarting the whole plan
[*] Unfortunately, after the [i]Yakuza 0[/i]'s riveting opening hours, the pacing slams on the brakes and reigns the whole thing in. It's not that the game becomes a boring real estate drama, but the second chapter really does have to ease up on the action to set up the rest of the narrative afterwards
[*] Because this takes four chapters to accomplish the setup (including introducing Majima, the game's other protagonist, along with his plotlines and motivations). There's a bit of a weird lull after the very exciting intro. Thankfully, the end of the fourth chapter onwards begins a more familiar ramp-up in intensity and stakes
[*] Although the plot itself is a fairly riveting crime thriller full of conspiracy and cutthroat ruthlessness, the dual antagonist approach adds a welcome layer of complexity. It's kind of fun recall the details of one character's plotline as new important details get dropped in the other's story. In addition to injecting a bit of dramatic irony, it's kind of fun to think, ""Oh man, Kiryu's in for a surprise"" as Majima learns of important developments
[*] In spite of the amount of brutality and underhandedness the story features, [i]Yakuza 0[/i] quickly becomes irreverent and silly once you take your eyes of the main storyline. It's an open world, after all, so you're due for all manner of bizarre side stories like helping a man who refuses to take off a jacket even though he keeps getting beaten up for wearing it or a becoming the friend of a cowardly cop who will only perform stop-and-frisks because he's too scared to address actual crimes
[/list]

[h1]Playability & Replayability[/h1]
[h3]Mash button[/h3]
[list]
[*] This game has ""stuff to do"" in spades. More stuff than I even wanted to bother with. At different junctures, you may find yourself engaged in real estate turf wars, recruiting women for your gentleman's club, trying to become friends with store clerks, trying to score a date at a telephone club, or entertaining yourself with a host of smaller minigames like bowling, darts, and batting cages
[*] As for the combat itself, I didn't find too much to latch onto mechanically. This isn't one of those beat-em-ups that's essentially a fighting game with more numerous and less spongy enemies. There's no real ""tech"". You just mash your weak attack button 1-5 times before switching to your strong attack button and maybe dodge out of the way every once in a while
[*] Both Kiryu and Majima have 3 unique fighting styles to choose from, each of which has its own quirks. I can tell by the number of skills devoted to switching styles that the player is supposed to adapt their fighting approach to the situation, but you don't really have to do that on the normal difficulty. I just picked Rush for Kiryu (not getting hit is a pretty surefire way of winning fights) and Slugger for Majima (mashing enemies into paste with a bat is also effective) and spent all my skill points on those
[*] Really, the only point you'll ever need to switch strategy from spamming a small collection of combos is when you reach a boss. Some are only staggered by certain attacks or vulnerable after you've parried or dodged. It doesn't take much experimentation to come up with a successful and exploitable plan
[*] I don't know if or when I'll be back for a replay. I've got a long series ahead of me

[h1]Overall Impressions & Performance[/h1]
[h3]In spite of itself[/h3]
[list]
[*] When all is said and done, [i]Yakuza 0[/i] shakes out to be, overall, an enjoyable experience, but one with some really obvious flaws. Narratively, the pacing suffers somewhat due to the decision to intertwine two connected narratives and sets of characters. The amount of time spent establishing the plot's major players and their motivations feels necessary given the scope of the story, but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable to play through. The first chapter ends on such an exciting note that the rest of the intro chapters begin to drag a bit
[*] I had originally planned on splitting my time with the game between my Steam Deck and my computer, but it performed so well on the Steam Deck that I didn't bother installing it on another device

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]7.0[/b]/10. [i]Yakuza 0[/i] isn't without its share of flaws, but it's still, as a package, a worthwhile experience if you're looking to dip your toes into the franchise. I wasn't impressed with the combat or how the story took its sweet time picking up steam after the opening chapter; however, the pleasingly constructed open world and fun action movie narrative wound up hitting most of the right notes on the way to the credits",True,Strategy

Yakuza 0,"the stuttering issue is just completely fucking insane and so goddamn annoying if the rest of the series on pc is like this im gonna jump off a cliff. this port is so fucked.

Yakuza 0,"Just beat the game, and I can safely say this takes the cake for my favourite game I've ever played. I'm astonished that the game design team for the combat was only two people. The fights are quick and snappy, and the bosses are the perfect length every time. All of the battle styles have a skill ceiling that feels like I've only scratched the surface of.

Going into the game I was expecting it to be just a goofy time based off of the various clips I've seen online, but I was NOT expecting it to have such a gripping storyline alongside it. Absolute Cinema. If there's one thing this game knows how to do, it's read the room. Not once did I think some goofy moment was at the wrong time, the game knows excactly when is the time for Majima Shenanigans™ and when is the time for some of the most heart-wrenching plot twists and dilemmas. 

You can really tell that this was a game made during a time where game developers focused on making games for the purpose of being fun, rather than just to make money. Every hour I played can be simply described as ""a damn good time"". I can confidently say that there was not a single moment in these 44 hours that I felt bored or frustrated (except that one hallway with the 3 guys with guns. fuck those guys), and I can also confidently say that I will be spending many more hours playing through all the postgame content. Had I known this game was going to be this good, I would not have waited months for it to go on sale. Absolutely worth full price. 10/10",True,Strategy

Yakuza 0,"Yakuza 0 is the perfect mix of hard-hitting crime drama and absolute, unhinged nonsense. One moment, you’re in a gripping, emotional story about honor, betrayal, and the criminal underworld; the next, you’re breakdancing in street fights, running a cabaret club, or helping a grown man buy “magazines” without getting caught.

The combat is fast, stylish, and endlessly satisfying, with Kiryu and Majima each having multiple fighting styles that let you brawl however you like. The neon-lit streets of 1980s Tokyo and Osaka feel alive, packed with side quests, minigames, and weird yet lovable characters.

Yakuza 0,You'd think this game is about the Japanese Mafia but you'd be surprised how much time you might end up playing Mahjong,True,Strategy
Yakuza 0,"TL; DR: An incredibly well written Japanese drama that could easily be a hit show, set in 80s Tokyo/Osaka, full of twists and high-intensity action.

A lesser game would not have gotten away with some of the things Yakuza 0 pulls off. Very long cutscenes, lots of random minigames, slightly clunky, at times annoying combat and at this point somewhat dated graphics. But this 10-year-old game puts even modern titles to shame.

The combat, even if slightly annoying at times, is surprisingly deep and takes a while to master. Combinations of different styles each with its own skill tree, gives it a lot of variety to fit different situations.

The gameplay outside of combat consists of going around Tokyo/Osaka's busy downtown and having small encounters, playing minigames or visiting surprisingly realistic bars, restaurants and various other locations. It all contributes to immerse you in the atmosphere of the city very effectively.

But where the game really shines is its story. Characters with a lot of depth, a plotline that keeps increasing in scope and twists, masterfully blending together the two protagonist's stories. Top-notch voice acting and much better facial expressions than other ""triple A"" titles. It really sucks you in and, like a good book, is hard to put down.

If you're into story-heavy action-adventure games, this is one of the best I've played.

Yakuza 0,"I don't really know why it took me this long to write a review of this game. I did not start my Yakuza journey with this game like most people, however I feel like I still appreciated it all the same as if I did. This game has soaked up quite literally all my time (it says 90 hours at time of review but my in game says 77ish?) and is my longest played Yakuza game (so far).. AND I'm still no where near done with everything in the game. This one (like the others) brings a great amount of content and if not even more than the others. Even with two playable characters there is soooo much to do. The Real Estate and Cabaret are the huge mini games in here and they are honestly a joy to complete, especially knowing that completing them will unlock Kiryu and Majima's Legend Styles. The other mini games are as usual unique and equally as fun as well (not looking at you mahjong). The combat in this game specifically is SUPER unique as well, giving each protagonist 3 separate fighting styles (as well as their ultimate as I mentioned earlier). Unlocking them have proved challenging, yet very rewarding... just don't wait til the end of the game like I did to train with the masters. I had a real hard time with some of the bigger fights because I wasn't immune/ couldn't dodge an attack after doing a combo, and the bosses were able to take chunks of my health quickly (not sure if that was a skill issue or I was just dumb and didn't train in moderation like the game intended me to lol). The story (oh my god the story, thanks again RGG) was amazing as the rest. This game had me hooked so so fast (knowing neither of them died kept me a bit from freaking out at certain parts but ya know) and it had me feeling all sorts of emotions -spiraling emotions, would be a better way to describe it. I kept saying how I just wanted to reach through the screen and give the boys hugs SO many times because of all the shit that always gets thrown their way. I have noticed that a lot of people struggle with this completion list (if that is your thing, getting the achievements on steam) but I haven't found anything too out of my reach just yet.

There are so many things to remind you that, in it's core, games are supposed to be... fun. The only criticism i have is the save function that forces you to go into a phone booth. I guess it encourages exploration, but i think they should make the pager doubles as a save mechanic. Overall, 8.8/10 game.

I played both Yakuza Kiwami 1 and 2 before Yakuza 0, which I think I regret a bit after starting this game. I think the best order would have been to start with 0 first, then Kiwami 1 and 2. I think it would have been better narratively speaking, but also jumping from the gorgeous graphics of Kiwami 2 to Yakuza 0 was a tiny bit jarring. The game doesn't look bad by any means, but it did take me a while to get used to.

As long as you aren't taking the game like a personal attack in the sense of 'how dare the game screw me' when it for the most part equally screws or benefits everyone the same than you'll be able to have fun, as long as you are able to figure out the mechanics of every single character's hyper-alongside every regular card available + specific combos with other cards and such as well, but sometimes ignorance is bliss.",True,Strategy

It's pretty fun if you have friends and/or the DLC; it's like if Mario Party was for multiplayer only. Apparently there's some kind of story but it didn't really catch my eye.

I have to say that I did not completely hate the original version, nor do I hate scholar, but I cannot really recommend that anyone who does not completely love DarkSouls play this one, it is a very poor introduction to this franchise/genera 
I also can see where people are coming from when they say that scholar ruined this game, though I find myself disagreeing.

DARK SOULS™ II,"The true irony of Dark Souls II is that it is not, in fact, a 'Dark Souls' game, and shouldn't be judged as such. 

What am I on about? Simple, really: DS II is, in fact, far more of an homage to King's Field and Demon's Souls than it is a proper sequel to Dark Souls 1 (DS3 fills that role far better). 

Is this game janky and half-baked? Very much so, yes. 

Is it a bad game? That depends: As a Dark Souls sequel? Yes, unfortunately. 

As a tribute to Dark Souls' aforementioned predecessors (which, by the by, are the main inspirations 'for' Dark Souls)? Not at all. In fact, when judged as such, it is actually a rather 'good' game, filled with a surprising number of innovative mechanics, both PVP and PVE related, that would have made the Demon's Souls sequel that we'll never see a masterpiece of gameplay in the early 2000's.  

In many ways (barring a few missteps such as 'adaptability' and the rightly-infamous 'soul counter'), Dark Souls II is mechanically-superior to its immediate predecessor, as it offers new and improved takes on old ideas such as dual-wielding, and implements a degree of environmental-interactivity that both Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 lack (hitting locked doors in order to lure enemies into opening them from within, and tricking strong enemy NPC's into collapsing walls with hidden treasure and pathways for you, for example). 

World design and overall layout is creative and thoughtfully put together. Majula, the most popular hub of all souls games for a reason, serves as a perfect focal point for the chosen undead's journey: providing outwardly branching pathways that lead to all areas of the game, giving the player freedom to explore at one's leisure that DS1 and 3 do not feature. Of course, not 'all' of the areas outside of Majula are winners (frigid outskirts and the gutter... @#$% those areas, honestly), but many, such as Shulva the sanctum city in 'Crown of the sunken King' (my personal favorite of the DLC areas), were clearly crafted with passion and attention to detail in mind.

Boss fights, unfortunately, are easily Dark Souls II's most glaring weakness, as they mostly amount to cheap gang-up fights (Elana the squalid Queen and the 'Throne watcher and throne defender-duo' as prime examples), though some, such as the Fume Knight (Crown of the Old Iron King DLC), are genuinely well-designed bosses that challenge you. Others, however, are the epitome of 'artificial difficulty' (Aeva the King's pet in the 'Crown of the Ivory King' DLC for example, even 'with' the item that allows you to see through her invisibility). In fact, some of the NPC invaders are more of a challenge than certain of the bosses (Covetous Demon)...

Items found in-world vary by exploitative-cheesiness (soul gems), but nothing is useless. Multiplayer items are cleverly dispersed through different parts of the game world and the same is true of base items such as throwing knives, of which there is a nice variety of types (poison, fire, lighting, magic) that weren't present in Dark Souls 1, and the same goes for arrows as well. Bonfire ascetics, one of the more controversial items, resets the area you are in to a NG+ state, which effects 'everything', including whatever boss is in the area. The dislike for this item is not something I agree with, as it provides a nice option for those who want to farm an area, while being challenged by tougher enemies as an offset for the attempt.

Overall sound design is effectively on-par with DS1's, though a few nice little variances are a welcome addition.

The 'fashion souls' aspect, nicely enough, is at its peak in DS2, and anyone who disagrees can go take a running jump down the pit that leads to the gutter in Majula.

All in all, this is the only Dark Souls game that made sincere attempts to innovate and experiment with the DS formula, though with varying degrees of success. Still, it deserves credit for at last 'trying', unlike DS3...

Final rating is 6/10 as a Dark Souls game, and 8.5/10 as a clear tribute to both Demon's Souls and King's Field.",True,Strategy

The main story mode is slightly weaker in quality, but the three fantastic DLCs are experiences to remember.

[h1]5/5[/h1]",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ II,"Dark Souls 2 is Dark Souls 2 so it's great. I did play Scholar first though and I enjoy the enemy placement more there than here since I feel it gives you more options overall on how to tackle each area so if you want to minimize combat it's possible once you realize how the aggro works and differs in each version.

The one caveat is that if you are a real fan of the genre you need to play both and you should play this game first so you can enjoy and better be able to take advantage of the new options Scholar offers in relations to this OG PS3/360 version. One thing to note that Scholar with the lighting engine mod plus texture mods does look nicer (not only that you can tweak each area to your liking and save your settings which is great) than this version but the plus for vanilla is that you don't really need to bother with torches for this one since the game never gets anywhere near as dark as Scholar where the torch or a light spell (haven't used it myself but I mean dark souls 1 had it gotta be here too right?) is basically mandatory in certain areas/locations.

I would be remiss not to mention that Keyboard and Mouse controls don't feel quite as smooth here and the camera seems to fight you a bit more in vanilla than it does in Scholar once everything is properly set up (both games have that annoying bug that you got to disable double click every time you start the game, that default is horrible and I can't fathom anyone playing with it enabled) but if you are on a gamepad I would think they control around the same. I basically need to lock on more in this version than in Scholar where I basically just use the mouse to free aim everywhere.

Another difference is that Scholar may throw more at you but they also added more summon signs so even if you are solo you can get an ai pal to help you out with some bosses that in vanilla as far as I can tell you got to solo yourself like the gargoyles.

Overall It's nice we got got two versions of the same game to enjoy and that's all folks!

DARK SOULS™ II,"Despite the fact that I've played it the least of the 3, and got into it the most recently, I have decided that Dark Souls 2 is my favorite of the trilogy.

If you want to play this game I would recommend that you:

- Level adaptability to 30 ish because it will give you the i-frames equivalent to about a light roll in the other dark souls games

- And get the ring of binding as early as you can so that when you are fully hollowed your health caps at 75% instead of 50%

DARK SOULS™ II,"After nearly a decade since first trying and bouncing off of Dark Souls, I finally got into FromSoft's Soulsborne library for real last year, starting with Bloodborne, then the original Demon's Souls, then taking care of unfinished business with Dark Souls. I was always super curious about Dark Souls II; its reputation preceded it, and yet a handful of friends both IRL and online actually enjoy it. Where would I stand?

Ultimately (aka tl;dr) it's a lesser game than the others—save maybe Demon's Souls—but yes, I did enjoy my time with it.

It's flawed, yes. Odd joystick deadzones make movement and camera controls feel imprecise. Hitboxes can seem a little off. Ripostes, backstabs, and even entering fog walls do not grant invincibility frames. Estus is a slow recharge rather than an instant fill. The adaptability stat is a baffling choice. The world doesn't have a congruent feel like DS1. Level design, for the most part, isn't as strong, including multiple instances where going off the beaten path rewards you with an item... and no way back other than die or homeward bone.

But... There are several neat elements that still make it engaging and a worthwhile experience. The story arc is compelling, with many enjoyable NPCs. There's so many kinds of weapons to play around with, and an easy way to redistribute stat points to try other builds without having to start over. The DLCs—their optional areas notwithstanding—are fantastically designed. And the game itself is rather gorgeous.

Ultimately, yes, I do think DS1 and Bloodborne are superior games that I prefer. But DS2 had many things that compelled me to keep playing despite its flaws, and that's got to count for something.",True,Strategy

The world is very beautiful and this game stands out the most in all of dark souls + elden ring + whatever because of how controversial it can be.

Must-buy if you are a souls fan.",True,Strategy
DARK SOULS™ II,"Too much hate on this game? Dunno. 
Game is actually fine, but it starts to be boring real quick, at least that was my experience. Maybe, it's because I'm coming from the first game in the series, but Dark Souls 2 doesn't feel like it has purpose. 

In the first game we had a narrative, a story I would say. And I saw a soul in Dark Souls 1. Here, I just don't see it. Exploring locations becomes boring and useless. There are some good ideas, but they often get drown by the enemy amount and enemy placement.  

I can't call this game unique in any sense, honestly. And it's definitely worse than the first one.

I did enjoy playing DarkSouls 2, and the original release was the first DarkSouls game I ever played, on the Xbox 360, probably around 2016. 
I have to say that I did not completely hate the original version, nor do I hate scholar, but I cannot really recommend that anyone who does not completely love DarkSouls play this one, it is a very poor introduction to this franchise/genera 
I also can see where people are coming from when they say that scholar ruined this game, though I find myself disagreeing.
I think that scholar improved this game in many ways, however I think that much of the game's original intent was lost with the sweeping changes

Ivory King: Tedious, annoying mechanics, horrible area design. Unfun bosses. Won't be playing it again.
Old Iron King: Fume knight is a good boss, everything else I did not enjoy. Very gank-ey.",True,Strategy

DARK SOULS™ II,"[h1] Reseña: Dark Souls 2 [/h1]

[h1] Historia [/h1]
Dark Souls 2 es un juego de acción  que se desarrolla en un mundo sombrío y devastado. Como es habitual en la saga Dark Souls, los jugadores deben explorar, enfrentarse a enemigos y jefes imponentes, y aprender de sus muertes. En esta entrega, los jugadores toman el control de un personaje conocido como el ""No Muerto"", quien debe recorrer el reino de Drangleic en busca de una cura para su maldición. El juego se caracteriza por su dificultad elevada, una narrativa críptica y una jugabilidad que recompensa la paciencia y la estrategia.

[h1] Jugabilidad 9/10 [/h1]
La jugabilidad de Dark Souls 2 es desafiante. El combate introduce nuevas mecánicas y armas que permiten una mayor movilidad. El sistema de bonfire, donde los jugadores pueden descansar para restaurar salud y enemigos, juega un papel clave en la exploración del mundo interconectado. La dificultad se centra en aprender los patrones de ataque de los enemigos y gestionar bien los recursos. Cada victoria, por pequeña que sea, se siente como un gran logro.

[h1] Gráficos 8/10 [/h1]
Aunque los gráficos no son tan avanzados como los de otros juegos, su estilo sombrío se adapta perfectamente al tono del juego. Los entornos son vastos y variados, desde castillos en ruinas hasta bosques misteriosos. Los detalles en los enemigos y jefes también contribuyen a la atmósfera tensa y opresiva del juego. Aunque la calidad visual puede no ser de última generación, el diseño artístico compensa con creces esta limitación.

[h1] Dificultad 10/10 [/h1]
Uno de los aspectos más emblemáticos de los souls. Cada enemigo y cada jefe tiene diferentes tipos de ataques por lo que debes de aprenderte los patrones de todo, ser preciso en los tiempos de ataque y bloqueos, y saber cuándo retirar, son aspectos fundamentales para sobrevivir. La dificultad no es para todos, pero para quienes buscan un reto genuino, Dark Souls 2 ofrece una de las experiencias más gratificantes.

[h1] Conclusion 9/10 [/h1]
Dark Souls 2 es una obra maestra. La jugabilidad, el diseño de niveles interconectados y la dificultad implacable hacen de este juego una experiencia única.",True,Strategy

DARK SOULS™ II,"The true irony of Dark Souls II is that it is not, in fact, a 'Dark Souls' game, and shouldn't be judged as such. 

What am I on about? Simple, really: DS II is, in fact, far more of an homage to King's Field and Demon's Souls than it is a proper sequel to Dark Souls 1 (DS3 fills that role far better). 

Is this game janky and half-baked? Very much so, yes. 

Is it a bad game? That depends: As a Dark Souls sequel? Yes, unfortunately. 

As a tribute to Dark Souls' aforementioned predecessors (which, by the by, are the main inspirations 'for' Dark Souls)? Not at all. In fact, when judged as such, it is actually a rather 'good' game, filled with a surprising number of innovative mechanics, both PVP and PVE related, that would have made the Demon's Souls sequel that we'll never see a masterpiece of gameplay in the early 2000's.  

In many ways (barring a few missteps such as 'adaptability' and the rightly-infamous 'soul counter'), Dark Souls II is mechanically-superior to its immediate predecessor, as it offers new and improved takes on old ideas such as dual-wielding, and implements a degree of environmental-interactivity that both Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 lack (hitting locked doors in order to lure enemies into opening them from within, and tricking strong enemy NPC's into collapsing walls with hidden treasure and pathways for you, for example). 

World design and overall layout is creative and thoughtfully put together. Majula, the most popular hub of all souls games for a reason, serves as a perfect focal point for the chosen undead's journey: providing outwardly branching pathways that lead to all areas of the game, giving the player freedom to explore at one's leisure that DS1 and 3 do not feature. Of course, not 'all' of the areas outside of Majula are winners (frigid outskirts and the gutter... @#$% those areas, honestly), but many, such as Shulva the sanctum city in 'Crown of the sunken King' (my personal favorite of the DLC areas), were clearly crafted with passion and attention to detail in mind.

Boss fights, unfortunately, are easily Dark Souls II's most glaring weakness, as they mostly amount to cheap gang-up fights (Elana the squalid Queen and the 'Throne watcher and throne defender-duo' as prime examples), though some, such as the Fume Knight (Crown of the Old Iron King DLC), are genuinely well-designed bosses that challenge you. Others, however, are the epitome of 'artificial difficulty' (Aeva the King's pet in the 'Crown of the Ivory King' DLC for example, even 'with' the item that allows you to see through her invisibility). In fact, some of the NPC invaders are more of a challenge than certain of the bosses (Covetous Demon)...

Items found in-world vary by exploitative-cheesiness (soul gems), but nothing is useless. Multiplayer items are cleverly dispersed through different parts of the game world and the same is true of base items such as throwing knives, of which there is a nice variety of types (poison, fire, lighting, magic) that weren't present in Dark Souls 1, and the same goes for arrows as well. Bonfire ascetics, one of the more controversial items, resets the area you are in to a NG+ state, which effects 'everything', including whatever boss is in the area. The dislike for this item is not something I agree with, as it provides a nice option for those who want to farm an area, while being challenged by tougher enemies as an offset for the attempt.

Overall sound design is effectively on-par with DS1's, though a few nice little variances are a welcome addition.

The 'fashion souls' aspect, nicely enough, is at its peak in DS2, and anyone who disagrees can go take a running jump down the pit that leads to the gutter in Majula.

All in all, this is the only Dark Souls game that made sincere attempts to innovate and experiment with the DS formula, though with varying degrees of success. Still, it deserves credit for at last 'trying', unlike DS3...

Final rating is 6/10 as a Dark Souls game, and 8.5/10 as a clear tribute to both Demon's Souls and King's Field.",True,Strategy

My Time at Sandrock,"It took me a long time to get around to getting this game because, to be frank, I just couldn't handle Portia. There was a lot wrong with Portia that turned me away from looking at this one and it turns out that was a mistake. They improved so much, they listened to the problems and made changes and made things better. The characters are better, the designs are better, the wait times for your resources are so much better and you can play at your own pace without your rivals picking up your slack and making you feel rushed (which was one of my problems with Portia as well) and the art style is so much better too as in Portia the character's wide eyes stared into my soul and kinda scared me. but i digress as this isn't a review for Portia. 

Sandrock took what they made with Portia to a new level and I loved every moment. In fact my ADHD butt usually never completes a game. I think I have only made a large game like this to completion once every couple of years as most games I get bored of and move on to a new game after a week or two. There was enough to hold my interest, the story was inviting, the characters were fun, the romantic options gave some great choices especially making me work for one of them and that one being a really great option. There was also enough to do that if i got bored of one thing i could explore, mine, take commissions, talk to townsfolk and a huge amount of side stories to keep me interested between all the main missions. I don't think since I have played raft I got to feel a little hollow spot where a game was filling now that I am done. The only down side was that leveling got a bit grindy at the end there but that happens sometimes. I suspect that like everything else they improved on with this game they will improve on that with the next one. 

The game was worth it and the only good thing in waiting for so long to actually get into this one is that maybe I won't have to wait too terribly long for Evershine to fill that little hole finishing this game has left in me. The down side is the kickstarter for Evershine is done and for the first time I might have been into supporting one. I will just have to wait until release date to give all the support these developers deserve for working so hard and giving me a great experience.

My Time at Sandrock is a more refined version of My Time at Portia, taking place in a different region. This time, you have to save the town from desertification, alongside helping others to make the town more appealing to newcomers and tourists. Visually, the game is much better, but the optimization isn't great. I had expected more before buying it – more freedom and fewer limits – but that's not the case. I hope the next game will address these issues.

The game is really lengthy in terms of quests and content, but don't expect anything truly surprising. It is more time-consuming to mine and extract resources, as they are limited in a way, and ore is mined differently now.

Anyway, if you're into Stardew Valley-like games, there's a good chance you'll like My Time at Sandrock. I would recommend getting the game with a discount, though.

2. Arvio getting in trouble by the pastor for plastering his face in the train station to advertise his store (Totally not narcissistic!!)
3. Qi building a mirror for Pen, while Pen harasses Qi daily basically showing up saying ""Are you done? Are you done? Are you done yet?"" All for Pen to be too mesmerized by his muscleness and having to be set free 
4. Fighting monsters side by side with Pen to prove our love while he makes comments of my arms and thighs... (Good times and very normal)

Can you tell Pen is my favorite yet? There is so much more to do. Definitely a huge improvement from My Time at Portia.

Also... They let you adopt a cute owl named CoCo, that's enough for me.

My Time at Sandrock,"I absolutely, positively ADORE Sandrock. My PC couldn't handle the game at the time, so while I have the game on steam, it shows I haven't played alot. However, I have played the game on my Switch and let me just say it has been amazing. I've run into very little issues with the game, most of the characters are charming, and the story kept me invested. I've played it like 3 times now. It's an absolute comfort and I'm so so excited to see what Evershine will be like. I feel bad I missed out on supporting it on Kickstarter but I'm definitely keeping an eye on Pathea games from now on. Definitely give the game a try if you like cozy games with a rich storytelling.",True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,This is a really enjoyable crafting game with simulation elements. The story and world are fantastic. Very enjoyable so far.,True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"It's already addictive.  If you liked the first one, definitely pick this one up.  Even if you haven't played the first one, grab one of the two.  Excellent games.  Fulfills the Stardew itch.  I actually like the commissions and building aspect of it a lot.  Controls may be a bit odd at first, but I got used to them quickly.  I prefer to use a mix of controller and mouse and keyboard as straight controller only is not great.  But the mix is perfect.

My Time at Sandrock,"One of the most immersive games I've ever played. The socializing, the way your workshop and the town progress as you play, the little holidays, the season changing.

My Time at Sandrock,"I was hesitant to play this because I didn't quite click with My Time at Portia, but wow this is awesome. They have put so much polish and effort into the game that it is easily one of my top 5 farming/small town games and better writing than anything I can remember from Natsume Harvest Moon. All the characters feel distinct and well written. The plot is very much saturday morning cartoon vibes until things start getting real dramatic. I started with the monster whisperer DLC so the water grind was very chill and combat never felt dangerous.

My Time at Sandrock,I play a lot of cozy games primarily Stardew Valley. What I love about My time at Sandrock is you get all the things that I loved about Stardew but you aren't forced to only farm. Sandrock gives you a bit more action and interesting things to do with your time other than farming. I like having options and you still get the marriage aspect as well as the immersive world. It's fun getting to know the characters and learning different trades.,True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"it's a good refresh from farming sim because it isn't so focused on farming and much more on crafting. But I'm still amazed that they make a game with battling being such a central feature of the game with such a broken crappy battling system. I mean it. Battling is just so bad that you have no challenge and not room for making strategies because it's so easy to handle. If you value a battling system, don't go for this game because you're gonna be frustrated. As I don't care, it's not a downer because I can focus on other things in the game and not be bothered to think much when battling, but I do feel like it's a little shameful that they released such a crappy battling mechanics when it's something so central to the story..",True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"623 hours logged into My Time at Portia. Another wonderful title, but it's still chock-full of bugs, and the optimization for performance still aren't quite there. Though that is true, I just recently got an RTX 3060, and it has been great playing another My Time game.

If you have the money and it's on sale, then get it, but if you are into life sims where you can date NPC's while progressing through the story, this might not be the game for you. For some NPC's(maybe most), you have to wait until towards the end of the storyline to even take them out on a date, regardless of whether or not you have a maxed out relationship with them. For me personally, I like to start dating as soon as possible to add to the richness of the story/plot so you can adventure together. Pretty annoying, but I guess this gives you time to consider your options with other NPC's if you somehow lose interest in the person you originally wanted to romance? I don't know. It's the worst feeling ever getting rejected when you have a maxed out relationship with an NPC.

The fact that you can't put down fencing/walls in your own yard is also pretty ludicrous. Absolutely terrible when in my Time at Portia, a game with far less customization options, gives you the option to do this with no hassle.

If you have the money, and it's on sale, definitely get it. My Time at Portia has some of the greatest soundtracks from any video game, and some of My Time at Sandrock's OST's can just about match My Time at Portia, which is pretty insane. Just make sure that you have at LEAST an RTX 3060. The frame drops can still get pretty bad with this title. I can't believe I'm saying this, but after 80+ hours, i can't recommend this game. Great story, buy bogged down by too many bugs, problems, and inconsistencies.",True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"Having played My Time at Portia first, coming to Sandrock felt like meeting up with an old friend who's grown better over time. The story links between the games create a world that old fans will enjoy but new players can still easily jump into—which is really important.

The story in Sandrock is really good, with characters that feel real and made me care about what happened to them. The hints about My Time at Evershine, especially with the Everglade story, have me excited for the next game.

If you played Portia, the gameplay will feel familiar, but almost everything has been made better. Farming feels more fun, and the building system fixes many problems Portia had. The desert setting brings new challenges that make Sandrock different from Portia, like having to watch how much water you use.

The side quests are great - they mix funny moments with touching ones that made me look forward to checking the commission board. I loved the references to shows like The Simpsons (""Dang Sandrockers! They ruined Sandrock!"") and other pop culture nods. Cooper is probably the funniest character! Just try not to fall asleep. ;)

Sandrock takes what was good about Portia and makes it even better. I often lost track of time while playing. If you enjoy life sims or want a fun world to spend time in, My Time at Sandrock is definitely worth playing.",True,Strategy

My Time at Sandrock,"A few years ago I played My Time at Portia and gave it a positive review.  

Sandrock took everything in Portia and made it better.  Better story, better characters, plenty of quality-of-life improvements.  And that's the thing about Pathea: They're better than any game-maker I know when it comes to listening to the players.  
Also, to be clear you don't have to play Portia first.  You'll see a few characters you saw in Portia, and a few references in Sandrock's dialogue to events and people in Portia, but you're not missing anything significant.

I put a good number of hours into Sandrock, though I admit it was over a year ago.  The positive review, though, is very much deserved, and it's better late than never.  Another My Time game is coming and I'll be first in line for it.

Note: This review applies to the base game only.  I see a lot of DLC that I didn't see when I was playing.  The outfit DLCs are what they are; not for me but you know exactly what you're getting if you're into that.  Look for reviews that address the additional mission DLCs; I've not played them--though now that I see them I'm tempted. . .

The reason for the negative review is the direction the game took at the Sandrock Strikes Back mission. In that mission, which forced me to stop playing the game, the combats and the story became ridiculous (spoiller alert: Matilda takes a bullet for Sandrock while planning to destroy Sandrock? Come on!) I understand this is a game. and the developer expects that the players will suspend their disbelief when playing the game, but for this to happen, there is a line that the developer should not cross. And in that game, the developer crossed the line.",False,Strategy

From a graphical standpoint, the game looks terrific. The building mechanics are more polished this time around, and more care and attention has been put into the voice acting. However, the game suffers in the actual 'game' department. It's functional, if a bit unpolished, but ultimately does not hold my attention long enough for me to care about Sandrock or the people in it.

The only thing I don't like is that it's set in a desert, a type of video game biome I abhor, but Sandrock's charm made the environment bearable for me. It's a wonderful game.",True,Strategy

My Time at Sandrock,"This is by far the weirdest farming/life sim I have ever played. 

The mechanics are cool and refreshing, focusing more on building things and commission work, which is a very nice change of pace from the standard farming sim. I found the combat to be fun and engaging, if not a little silly for how souls-like it is for a ""cozy game"". The mining portions are a little bland and tedious, and I did not like the artifact system at all. You get pieces of artifacts randomly when mining that you need to put together, and you can either display it at the museum, in your home, or gift it to someone. I get the appeal but personally it was such a pain and waste of inventory space, as I end up with like 3 of the same pieces and am unable to do anything with them. theres also no incentive to even find the artifacts, aside from 2 quests for Qi. The ranching mechanics, I didnt like at all. It takes up too much of your very limited lawn space, and just isnt very fun. Also, the home design and renovation mechanics need major fixing in Pathea's next game FOR SURE, it's so stressful and the camera never wants to behave.

Design wise, it definitely had to grow on me. I still find some character designs to be jarring (Miguel weirds me OUT,, idk why he's just so uncanny looking to me) and the scaling of some characters is weird (Like. Jasmine is almost bigger than her mom lol) but I'm used to it by now. Some of the animals, not so much. I love the yakmels but the rabbits (or rabbit equivalent) are freaky and way too big. The voice acting is hit or miss for me. Some of it is REALLY good, the majority is okay, and then there are some oddballs. Pablo and Haru sound like they were recorded in a different studio, and both of them are giving absolutely nothing like 80% of the time. its a little funny to be honest. Yan's VA did a good job but he's way too loud and grating on the ears, but that might just be a sound mixing problem. I love Catori's voice, I have absolutely no idea why they gave her a Long Island accent but it makes me laugh. 

Where this game really shines, in my opinion, is its writing. I was not expecting it to be so involved and well planned. Usually in life sims the writing is kind of an afterthought, cause the assumption is that you're there to farm and interact with the npcs and thats it, but I love story-driven games. I love how much thought went into the world building and how the environment plays such a huge role in the story. I don't want to spoil the story, but I was NOT expecting things to escalate so much. The character writing is also a huge highlight for me. It's so funny. I have no idea what Unsuur is on but he says the dumbest shit and it's delightful, he's definitely a favorite of mine. I also like that the npcs themselves are more involved and you can do more with them, plus the mechanic of reverse-confessions, dialog choices to convey romantic interest, and being able to hang out with them. Though I wish there was a little more dialog variation in hangouts/dates, especially depending on whether your relationship is platonic or romantic. 

Overall a very charming game. I haven't finished the main story yet but I'm pretty close, but I'm having a blast",True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"I was extremely pleasantly surprised by this game! I was initially hesitant to purchase it (especially since it was full-priced at the time), but in my opinion, it was worth every penny and more. After 90 hours of gameplay, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface.

**Pros:**
- The story is fantastic—a perfect blend of humor and emotion. I almost cried reading a diary I found while exploring an old ruin, then laughed out loud at something Unsuur said.
- The marriage candidates (and townspeople) are all diverse and engaging. They each have distinct personalities, and as the story progresses, you really grow fond of them.
- The game progression feels smooth and thoughtfully designed. There was only one instance where I was unsure of ""what to do next,"" but the game magically provided the required quest the following day. With no prior “My Time In...” experience, I was able to intuitively access my inventory, gather materials, craft, and take on jobs—all without heavy tutorials.
- Character creation offers a lot of options for customizing hair color, styles, face shapes, etc. However, I do wish there were more combinations than just the ""Lucy"" face shape and default nose to create a wider range of attractive characters.
- Your mom exists outside of the game and sends you letters! This was such a cute and heartwarming addition to the gameplay.
- Simple activities like digging and chopping wood with the controller feel so satisfying. The animations are excellent, and the controller feedback is spot on.
- I appreciate how long it takes to romance some of the characters. While this might be a negative for some, I actually enjoy the fact that it isn’t too easy for certain characters!
- Lastly, I have a lot of fun checking the request board each day and fulfilling requests. It’s very satisfying to deliver the requested items, especially when it boosts both friendship and funds.

**???**
- Personally, I’m not a fan of midwestern accents, so I switched the voice acting to Chinese. I was pleasantly surprised by how great the Chinese VA is!

**Cons:**
- I wish the furniture and decor styles weren’t as cartoony. I’m really looking forward to *My Time In Evershine* because I prefer that aesthetic.
- Although farming isn’t a central part of the game, I do wish it felt a bit more satisfying.
- There are already a lot of cute clothes in the game, but I wish there were more variety!",True,Strategy

My Time at Sandrock,"So I bought this game plus a copy for my wife and we were super excited to play through it together. We started playing but the more we played the weirder it seemed that nothing was happening, no story was going on and no interesting quests were showing up.

Turns out that multiplayer in this game is a storyless sandbox mode, which completely ruins the entire reason for even playing it. You are just building for the sake of it.

The game also doesn't TELL you any of this up front, before buying or when starting to play, happily pretending that you are going to play some version of the actual game. You are left to figure this out yourself off the back of your own wasted money and time.

I basically bought two copies of a bait-and-switch. I would gladly refund it if I still could, it was nothing but a big disappointment and a total waste of time and money.",False,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"I have bought this game to play multiplayer with a buddy. I was not aware that the multiplayer mode is just a sandbox crafting mode without the story part of single player. I could be fine with that but what really kills it as a multiplayer experience: the objects and NPCs are not synchronized between us?! I see NPCs or resources that are not at the same spot as in my buddie's game screen. 

This game may be great for single player but for multiplayer the non-alignment of the world for participating players is a show stopper and kills all immersion and cooperation.",False,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"Possibly more addictive than My Time at Portia. I haven't finished the game yet, but the story so far has been engaging. I don't (usually) feel overwhelmed with activities. Days where multiple events can occur at once are an exception. 

A lot of features have been improved on (eg: you can repair things/build on the assembly station/turn in commissions without having the item(s) in your hand or backpack; so long as they're in your inventory at home, you're good to go). The only thing I find myself missing from MTaP is a piece of furniture like the reclining chair that refilled your stamina bar super quickly. I'm sure that if I went looking for a mod like that, I could find one, but I'm enjoying the game enough on its own to not have any interest in modding my first playthrough. 

The townies are delightful, and fun to get to know. None feel like copy/pastes of each other. Getting to be friends with people in the game feels rewarding, and earned. Also, the romance is kind of blowing me away. I've been pursuing Owen, and it's been cool to see him return my interest and even plan activities on his own. It doesn't feel like I'm just buying affection or interest with gifts. Doing the story missions and slowly getting to know the people in town naturally has made the developing relationships feel much more authentic.

MTaS is funny, with the same sort of humor and charm that I loved about MTaP. This is the epitome of cozy gaming to me; this series has so much heart, I can't help but adore it, even when it's not always perfect.

Good game, very fun, would make heart-eyes at Owen again.",True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"Such an amazing experience, and one that hits close to home, as the game reminded me of one of my most favorite PS2 games ""Barnyard"" :p.

My Time At Sandrock is a sequel to My Time At Portia with better graphics, more balanced economy (Sadly Fishing is nerfed..), and more variety in the combat system with the addition of Firearms and a ton of unique weapons with their own movesets. However, the game is set in a DESERT. 

At first I honestly found the environment ugly and frankly preferred the more luscious greenery of Portia with the hills and rivers, but the developers managed to make a dying town in a barren Desert as INTERESTING as Portia's more cozy, peaceful experience. While Portia's builder takes over the workshop after his/her father retires, offering a wholesome experience with the player trying to rebuild their family's workshop back to it's former glory and getting to know the townies their father used to cherish, much like Stardew Valley, Sandrock does not follow the same premise, instead you're being employed by the town to replace a retiring builder and you find yourself in a town that you have no connection to whatsoever, even worse the town has No rivers, No Trees, and a ton of trash lying around. It is the builder's job to transform this dying old town back to it's former glory. 

Just like Portia and Barnyard in the PS2, you feel good when you make upgrades and see your progress in buildings and structures around you.

In Barnyard you upgrade the Barn and more and more NPCs use your upgrades and start hanging out and using the upgrades you made. Sandrock follows the same formula, but SCALES it up with bigger structures bigger buildings and bigger upgrades that push the story forward in a way that gives you satisfaction not seen before in previous installments of the franchise. 

While Portia's community upgrades aim to better the quality of life, Sandrock gets deeper, the builder not only tries to better the quality of life by building upgrades but also solve problems left by previous generations.

In conclusion, Sandrock has been a great experience with surprising plot twists, funny dialogues and an amazing cast of characters that evolve and grow throughout the game.",True,Strategy
My Time at Sandrock,"[h2] It's fine, but it could have benefited from further refinement. [/h2]
It goes on for far too long. After the action-packed missions are completed, the main story continues for quite a while and becomes rather stale, as there isn't much left for you to do. You'll most likely end up skipping days just to reach the conclusion and finish it.

While there are a few activities available even in the late game, they aren't sufficient to keep you engaged or intrigued.

[h3] Storytelling and Characters: [/h3]
The inclusion of voice acting is a nice touch. While not every side quest or interaction is voice-acted, the main content is.

You'll encounter older characters from the first game, My Time at Portia, which is a sweet addition. However, their voices differ from the first installment, which might be slightly distracting. It’s not a major issue, but I do wish they had retained the original voice actors or found similar ones to maintain continuity.

That said, I’m glad the old cast makes occasional appearances.

Speaking of voice acting, am I the only one who hears DangerousFunny from YouTube in the character of Pablo from this world? When I heard his voice, I thought he was the one performing it.

[b] Anyway, it's a nice change of pace to work together with another builder instead of always competing against each other, as you do in Portia. [/b]

[*] I enjoy how the stories, cities, and characters are interconnected between the worlds of these two games

[*] Characters actually develop a little, and things change around the city with missions. Unfortunately, the story is quite linear; while you have choices, they don't significantly impact how events unfold.

[*] Numerous side content pieces are well-written and extremely entertaining. The Bogan Jack stuff, for instance, is very amusing.

[*] The interactions with your childhood friend, mother, and father through letters are heartwarming.

I actually liked the father and mother better in the letters than in person, haha.

[*] Certain characters are, in fact, hilarious: Pen, Justice, Cooper, Andy, Unsuur, Bronco the Kid, Yen, and Qi. They all gave me a good chuckle, and I greatly appreciate that.

[*] I like that it takes longer to build relationship points with characters; somehow, this makes it feel a little more real.

You have a variety of choices in the romantic department as well; the populace is quite charming. Nevertheless, I picked Grace—she's cool.

Not all the citizens are particularly significant, but still.

[*] Most of the dialogue seems somewhat childish, and I was caught off guard when more serious events started happening. The political aspects, the conflicts between regions, the plot twists, and the conspiracies are all quite interesting.

Silly stuff happens as well, though, like spoiler alert:
[spoiler] Logan stealing Matilda without getting detected in the middle of the desert. No one saw him or heard him coming at all. How? Lol. [/spoiler]

[u] It's nice for what it is, but it goes on for far too long after certain plots are resolved. [/u]

[h3]  Progression, Crafting, Combat Systems, and Boss Fights: [/h3]

[*] The fact that you don't need to have the required items for commissions in your inventory saves you time and effort. The same goes for the museum, where construction items and other materials are stored—it's definitely a big plus.

[*] Gameplay is enjoyable, with elements like exploration, item collection, and resource gathering. You then use these to craft and upgrade your equipment and workspace.

[*] The save mechanic, allowing you to save whenever you want, is great. You also have auto-save when progressing through the game or sleeping—sweet!

[*] The mines differ a bit in this game, which is nice. I actually prefer them here over the ones in Portia.
Just because no one has explicitly mentioned it—floor 11 of both the Eufaula and Gecko ruins has no exit because it's the lowest level.

You have to manually exit the ruins from the map, then re-enter to reach the next level and continue.

I saw some players mention that they spent two in-game weeks and three real-world days removing all the dirt from the last level, searching for an exit.

It should have been mentioned somewhere.

[*] Farming is not the main focus of this game, but it is included, and it's a great addition!

[*] ""I can't seem to find the recipe for Chromium Steel Bar in the Guild Store.""

""I had the same problem not long ago. It's strange since you need Chromium for some things before you actually unlock the ability to get it. Progress through the story a bit more, and it will appear in the Guild Store after a little while""

[b] As you can see here, progression can be weird occasionally. [/b]
They should let you upgrade your existing storage rather than making you create new ones. It would save time.

[*] AUTO-FILL button for chests is very useful!

[*] Your inventory is huge; I'm fond of this detail!

[*] Fishing is pretty fun in this game

[*] This game provides a lot more to level up than Portia, which is a fantastic addition.

Each category—gathering, workshop, combat, and social—has its own distinct level system.

[*] The combat system and all the bosses aren't anything too fancy; they're just there and they are okay

You might run into a few bugs.
Such as the duster mechanic: even after I clean it, the uncleaned icon still appears. I have to pick up the construction and put it down again for it to be fixed.
This also slows machine progress when it indicates they haven't been cleaned, despite already being cleaned.

[h3] The Visuals and Music: [/h3]

The music is good for what it is, and the graphics are all right. However, some characters have strange facial expressions, and they disappear entirely from several scenes, as if ghosts were talking, not them.

The atmosphere is soothing and engaging, creating a welcoming and immersive experience.
Even so, invisible walls blocking a straight path, preventing further progress on the map, can break immersion a bit.

Let's get something clear: Logan doesn't weigh more than Owen, nor does he have more muscle.

Logan: 94 kg
Owen: 90 kg

Look at their designs next to each other and tell me you believe their descriptions.

[h3] In summary [/h3]

It's a good game, but it could have been a great one. This happens because the focus is on quantity over quality. The developers have been somewhat lazy, and this can be seen at every corner.

That's a pity, considering Sandrock has great potential but remains just that—lost potential. With more polish and effort, it could have been something special, in my opinion.

There is a lot of filler content—scenes that don't give you anything: no entertainment, no new information; they are just there.

My Time at Sandrock,"It took me a long time to get around to getting this game because, to be frank, I just couldn't handle Portia. There was a lot wrong with Portia that turned me away from looking at this one and it turns out that was a mistake. They improved so much, they listened to the problems and made changes and made things better. The characters are better, the designs are better, the wait times for your resources are so much better and you can play at your own pace without your rivals picking up your slack and making you feel rushed (which was one of my problems with Portia as well) and the art style is so much better too as in Portia the character's wide eyes stared into my soul and kinda scared me. but i digress as this isn't a review for Portia. 

Sandrock took what they made with Portia to a new level and I loved every moment. In fact my ADHD butt usually never completes a game. I think I have only made a large game like this to completion once every couple of years as most games I get bored of and move on to a new game after a week or two. There was enough to hold my interest, the story was inviting, the characters were fun, the romantic options gave some great choices especially making me work for one of them and that one being a really great option. There was also enough to do that if i got bored of one thing i could explore, mine, take commissions, talk to townsfolk and a huge amount of side stories to keep me interested between all the main missions. I don't think since I have played raft I got to feel a little hollow spot where a game was filling now that I am done. The only down side was that leveling got a bit grindy at the end there but that happens sometimes. I suspect that like everything else they improved on with this game they will improve on that with the next one. 

The game was worth it and the only good thing in waiting for so long to actually get into this one is that maybe I won't have to wait too terribly long for Evershine to fill that little hole finishing this game has left in me. The down side is the kickstarter for Evershine is done and for the first time I might have been into supporting one. I will just have to wait until release date to give all the support these developers deserve for working so hard and giving me a great experience. I will be here on the edge of my seat waiting for you. And heck, I always wait till things go on sale but I think for the first time I will most likely pay full price for the next game.",True,Strategy

My Time at Sandrock,"I happened upon the ""My Time franchise"" while looking for something similar to Harvest Moon and Rune Factory.
Here farming was switched with crafting ""or building"" but in all other aspects it plays just like those games.
 
The core of the game is resource gathering and crafting to complete story quests, side quests and earn some money. Money in turn can then be spent on building and upgrading all the various machines used for crafting, but also expanding your yard, building a bigger house, or spending time with NPC's.

Like in RF and HM, Social simulation also plays a big part in My Time at Sandrock. There are plenty of people inn town to befriend or even date and eventually marry. The characters are really well developed and makes it hard to pick a favourite.

The dialogue is in most cases are funny which adds to the charm. The side content will take you from running dungeons to fishing and farming and cover a variety of mini games!

My Time at Sandrock,"Definitely better than My Time at Portia in terms of quality of life features. The only downside is that early game is way less forgiving than My Time at Portia. The weekly ruin fee is 200 instead of the usual 100, and fishing isn't as good as it was in Portia, as evidence to the constant ""Sand Trap is too small"" messages I'm getting. Not to mention, the Fast Travel system now cost Gols to use, instead of being free. Tin is [slightly] harder to get, so you won't be able to do one of the early main story missions as easily. In order to unlock lower depths of the ruins, you have to find the doorway that is sparkling further in the current layer/depth. Inventory Management is still a bit of a pain, but the new sort option is amazing, and will even auto-store items if you're looking in a storage container that has items stored that are in your bag/backpack. (Auto-Storing also stores to nearby storage containers, not just the one you're looking in.) Combat is a little more involved this time with a new ""Break"" system, which if Guild Wars 2 has taught me anything, is going to be my worst enemy on higher difficulty enemies.

Besides all that, I think my biggest annoyance is the game's reliance on gating your recipes to the main story. The Guild Commerce Store has the majority of the recipes needed for the in-between materials for higher end items/gear/etc. But they aren't sold until you get to certain parts of the story, even if you can get the base materials for those recipes hours ahead of time. Combat is quite annoying sometimes. Like the first game, combat will often have you attack through or past enemies, forcing you to turn toward them often. The new Break system doesn't stop skills either for most enemies, even though it feels like it should.

Game has a tendency to become highly unstable if left running for hours even if paused on a menu.",True,Strategy

My Time at Sandrock,"I can’t recommend this game enough—it’s everything!  As someone who enjoys crafting, farming, and building, this game feels like it was made just for me.

The desert town of Sandrock is stunning and full of life, with vibrant characters and an atmosphere that feels so immersive. I loved getting to know the quirky NPCs, each with their own stories and personalities. The relationships you build—whether friendships or romances—feel genuine and rewarding, and they add so much heart to the experience.

The crafting system is deep and satisfying, giving me a real sense of accomplishment as I built up my workshop from scratch. Whether it’s creating essential tools or massive machines, the progression is incredibly rewarding. The farming mechanics are also unique, with water conservation adding a fun twist that fits perfectly with the desert setting.

Exploration is another highlight—there are so many places to discover, from ancient ruins to hidden treasures. It’s like there’s always something new to do or uncover, and I never felt bored. The game’s music and visuals are also beautiful, drawing me further into its charming world.

Thief,"It's just like, really boring. Like some of the gameplay, sneaking past guards or knocking them out is kinda fun. But the player character is weak as hell so anything other than bopping enemies on the back of the head feels pretty useless. Visually the game is pretty nice with good visual effects and animations.

Exploring feels really pointless and tedious. Like in order to open drawers, or windows, or doors, and animation has to play for EACH one. Find a desk with 6 drawers in it and you want to check to see if there's anything valuable in it? okay press E 6 times and wait for the 2 second animation for each one to play and then get rewarded with a small amount of gold. What do you do with said gold? well there's a shopkeeper who has 3 tools that allow you to traverse alternative paths in some of the levels. Once you get that you really just have arrows and some small upgrades that don't really help or change a lot. So if there isn't anything interesting to buy with the gold why would you go through the effort and time to search through and steal all the little trinkets? I don't know. 

This feels like Dishonored with better graphics and much much worse gameplay and story. Oh yeah the story? eh I didn't pay too much attention to much of it. Go talk to a guy, he tells you to go steal something, you do the mission, oh no something went wrong! run away, escape and wake up in your base. Rinse and repeat for the first half(?) of the game and then some more narrative stuff happens but they don't really develop any characters enough to make you care what happens or why. 

Idk, I got it on sale for 4 CAD so I don't really feel bad for spending the money on it, but I also don't think it's worth much more than that. If youre looking for a stealth game, play Dishonored orDishonored 2. Those games at least have some charm and interesting magic mechanics.",False,Strategy

Thief,I love the Thief series. I love the change in pace and graphics when they did Deadly Shadows and the major progress in Thief (4). I was an original Thief fan and I am a die hard one. Been with this series for 26 years! We need another one!,True,Strategy
Thief,"Disclaimer: I'm not an old school Thief fan, tried playing the first one and didn't really like it.

Graphics:

Probably the best aspect of the game, it just looks great, the enviroments and characters, I love how it looks in the dark, it's moody while still allowing you to see what's going on, not that's worth all the loading screens, but we will get to that.

Sound:

Awful, the sound mixing is all over the place, there are conversations between characters where they are in completely different volumes, one really loud and the other really quiet.

Story:

I'll admit I don't really get what's going on, something about an object that gives power or something and people want it, but they can't control it, the girl in the beginning of the game disappears and we spent most of the game going after her, even thouhgh don't know or care about her, you shouldn't play this for the story.

Gameplay:

Decent at times, the game is open world, you get to explore the city and find collectibles and treausres throughtout, it's actually a pretty decent open world, the main missions are done in separate levels outside the open world alongside some of the side jobs you get, some of these are pretty decently designed, but never go beyond just being okay.

The movement and actual stealth is pretty satisfying, but the biggest problem with the gameplay is navigating the open world, it's a chore, first because there are loading screens everywhere, if you wanna go from one end of the map to the next you need to go through at least 4 or 5 loading screens depending on your path.

And on your way there you meet guards, which some of them are pretty hard to pass through, being pretty time consuming to do it stealthly forcing you to just fight them, which is faster, but hard because this is a stealth game, I recommend getting the combat upgrades as fast as possible, it will avoid annoyances.

One thing that is weird about the game is the fact there are three types of play, ghost, opportunist and predator, each mission has side objects connected to each of these playstyles, but at the end of each mission the game tells you which playstyles you preferred, which doesn't necessarilly makes any sense, sometimes I would just knock out everyone and still tell me I was an opportunist or something.

But, get this, the game only rewards you for the side objective connected to the playstyle that you finished the mission on, so even if you complete all side objects you only get rewarded for the objective of your playstyle, one time the game said I was balanced among all three styles so it gave no reward for any of the three bonus objectives.

The game doesn't tell you that and you have to figure it out halfway through after spending so much time doing the damn bonus objectives, but to be fair the rewards are so miniscules that they don't really matter, the best way to make money is to just loot everything in the game anyway.

Bugs:

Navigating the open world is annoying enough, but the amount of bugs is even worse, you will find enemies just walking to doors infinitely withou opening them, loading is a gamble in this game, sometimes you will load a previous save and have enemies missing on the map, or just standing in place instead of doing their normal patrols, forcing you to adapt your playstyle to the bugs.

Which is actually the most challenging part of this game which is not that hard, I played on thief difficulty, which is the normal difficulty, which wasn't particularly challenging, the best chapter in the game, in my opinion, chapter 6, is one of the easiest ones.

Conclusion:

I would recommend this game to hardcore stealth fans, since you can get it pretty cheap for being an old game, anyone else should just avoid it, at it's best moments is okay and at it's worst is pretty weak, I also recommend playing with a controller.

4/10",False,Strategy
Thief,"I never played any Thief games, so this is my first one. I have to say, I've never played something awful as this one. The game is absolutely underwhelming. It has a very boring story teeming with uninteresting monologues from the MC.

The thieving aspect of the game feels unrewarding. Your items are mostly spoons, cups, scissors. Picking locks can lead you to have the most insulting reward at times, like just a stack of 20 gold coins. Rare items are unfortunately collectibles for your home to display neatly in case. You can't sell them...
Adding to that, there isn't really anything you can do during free roam other than break in defined places that might be packed with a few silver spoons or cups. Sometimes there are things to lockpick. But here's the stinker, nobody is ever home. The thrill of being ever detected only happens in a few jobs or main story quest. But that's where the stinker is, the AI is so terrible, at times also buggy, that this completely ruins my immersion as a stealthy thief.

The thief's gadget only consists of a bow, blackjack and lockpicks. However, he does have a grapple hook which is only used during cutscenes... What???!! Why can't we use that?!

This leads to the final thing to rant about:
The game design is just sad. Everything is linear, no variations in characters/enemies. It's always the same kind of enemy just patrolling. Places to hide in the shades feel barely shady at all. It feels at time immersion breaking when a dark room, lit with a few lights, makes you unseen in one dark corner, where frankly , you look still visible. Your sneaking will usually be climbing up somewhere to break into a room, from an open window, or if you're lucky, there's a vent to unscrew to crawl in. You just can't use your bow and rope arrow to climb up anywhere but designated blue-highlighted places. 
The set-up of the events gets weirder as you progress. When you free roam in the stonemarket, only briefly a cutscene happen, but it's so weird because it feels inconsistent with the story and lore that you collect through documents an newspapers you see around. There's a curfew, yet you still see people roaming around, saying the same uninteresting shit ever. Speaking of dialogues, for a stealth game, the sound design is horrible. You hear occasional dialogues when passing windows that are lit, yet you can't break in, they're just scripted. Lazy dev decisions, I guess. Footsteps and voices from any other floors are also heard in your level.

None of the characters are interesting. I stopped caring since chapter 2, simply because there isn't really a stake. A blight is spreading in the city, but the MC doesn't care much, because he's a emo loner thief because that's who he 'is' when he wanted to break the biggest safe. This game should be called 'Garret the Kleptomaniac'.

This game, while mechanically ok, can be frustrating with the vast amount of loading screens to traverse the different areas of the city.  This is not an open world, do what you please type of game.  This is like Mass Effect Andromeda type of frustrating loading issues.  The game is also not helped by a main story that is utterly confusing at the best of times. Just the ending alone made no sense.  The only fun thing is trying to figure out how to get all the loots.  You need a bunch of equipment and special arrows to reach all the loot and collectibles.  Which is fun.  Does it make this game worthy of a playthrough...not really.  While I had some fun and spent 24 hours in the game, there are some hours I would like back.",False,Strategy
Thief,"It's just like, really boring. Like some of the gameplay, sneaking past guards or knocking them out is kinda fun. But the player character is weak as hell so anything other than bopping enemies on the back of the head feels pretty useless. Visually the game is pretty nice with good visual effects and animations.

Exploring feels really pointless and tedious. Like in order to open drawers, or windows, or doors, and animation has to play for EACH one. Find a desk with 6 drawers in it and you want to check to see if there's anything valuable in it? okay press E 6 times and wait for the 2 second animation for each one to play and then get rewarded with a small amount of gold. What do you do with said gold? well there's a shopkeeper who has 3 tools that allow you to traverse alternative paths in some of the levels. Once you get that you really just have arrows and some small upgrades that don't really help or change a lot. So if there isn't anything interesting to buy with the gold why would you go through the effort and time to search through and steal all the little trinkets? I don't know. 

This feels like Dishonored with better graphics and much much worse gameplay and story. Oh yeah the story? eh I didn't pay too much attention to much of it. Go talk to a guy, he tells you to go steal something, you do the mission, oh no something went wrong! run away, escape and wake up in your base. Rinse and repeat for the first half(?) of the game and then some more narrative stuff happens but they don't really develop any characters enough to make you care what happens or why. 

Idk, I got it on sale for 4 CAD so I don't really feel bad for spending the money on it, but I also don't think it's worth much more than that. If youre looking for a stealth game, play Dishonored orDishonored 2. Those games at least have some charm and interesting magic mechanics.",False,Strategy

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited.

Shadowrun Returns,"While the gameplay was excellent, and the combat system was interesting i cannot for the life of me reccomend this game to others for several reasons.

1. it is short too short, the campaign is like 8 hours long, and has little replay value unless you want to make a new character for a different playstyle. i also have a big problem with having a beautiful map that i only get to explore for like 5 minutes before im stuck in the bar talking to a meth dealer in a trench coat for the chance to taste the sweet sweet outside air. also the fact that i cannot new game plus my character frustrates me to no end.

2. while the setting had amazing potential (think cyberpunk with spells and shit). I think this game failed to live up to its full potential with writing and lack of content. I know i can supplment the content through mods but is shouldnt have to do that. its like as if the dessert was the main course.

3. The writing. My god did the writing suck. It some fat black lesbian weeb who browses tumbler all day wrote the story for the game. Before you accuse me of being racist, she literally has a self insert character you meet 30 minutes into the story. Every time a character added a random japanese word like ""omae"" or boku while speaking english i wanted to wash my eyes with bleach and curse god for giving humanity the ability to put their thoughts into words. I am certain this weeb author has never talked to a japanese person in their life and should never do so lest her stench drive them away. 

also i hate the fact your dialogue options forces you to be walmart deadpool. It doesnt matter what dialogue choices you make in the beginning you will become walmart deadpool  whether you like it or not. 

despite my gripes with the main campaign i sense ENORMOUS potential with modding. Dont like the main story? write your own. Dont like the map? build it yourself. But the fact that this main campaign was so godamn dogshit frusterates me to no end.

so overall the combination of poor writing, no open map, and weebness so cringe it breaks any sense of immersion you might have i cannot reccomend this game, unless you want to create your own levels and play it yourself.",False,Strategy

It is turn based and linear; you go out on missions, then return to your home to level up, re-supply, pick up side missions, and progress the story.

At first I was disappointed, but the story and atmosphere sucked me in.

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited. There's no point in making a troll as anything other than a Samurai or Physical Adept, for example, as their racial limits would prevent any other class' skills rising above 6 points (out of 15)

FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"Final Fantasy X is one of the greatest games ever made, and that is a very exclusive club. I won't waste your time by saying what's good about it, as others who are more eloquent than me have already done a better job of that. If you have never played this game before, this Steam version is definitely worth your time. However, there are some issues with this version, most notably that there are new character models which have had mixed reactions with fans of the original PS2 version.

There also seems to be an issue with recent updates causing the game to crash or have some other breakage, but I haven't launched the Steam version in two years (I prefer to play the original PS2 version on physical hardware, and it's a yearly replay for me.) So please be careful and verify that it works with your hardware. Steam is very generous with their refund policy. 

The Steam version of this game comes with some quality of life features which are not present in the original PS2 version. You may find them useful if you have no patience for older games that take their time to tell their stories. 

This Steam version also comes with Final Fantasy X-2, which I played a little bit, but I can't recommend because I didn't play very much and don't know enough about it. I would like to make clear that the story's premise didn't stick for me, and the themes at the beginning hours of the game that I played where not enough to keep me interested. However, it has the best title-menu theme song in the entire franchise, in my opinion. I liked the song a lot. You might, too.",True,Strategy
FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"Finally experiencing this game 24 years later after release... I started this up with no nostalgia & shockingly spoiler free. That is despite playing most of the mainline Final Fantasy franchise. Being rooted as a 2001 console game means many parts of this game are a product of its time, however that being said some of the outdated aspects give it a charm that allows that fact to not ruin a good game. 

Pros:
-Engaging story with thick lore.
-Memorable characters. 
-Good gameplay mechanics.
-Some beautiful FMVs.
-Good amount of individual character customization for abilities, stats, & equipment. A system that really lets you go far with it if desired.
-First game in the series to include voice acting.
-Lots of optional side quests and end game quests for those who want to do more.
-Great music.

Cons:
-Story is rather convoluted & at times very confusing. If you are not a lore hound & either take the time to fully explore it all within the game or educate yourself in it online it can come off as nearly nonsensical. Had I not taken the effort to deep dive into the lore & looked for various explanations I suspect I could have played this game 3 times and not fully understood its multi layered themes and narratives.  
-Being a 2021 title I was expecting this games frame rate to be easily matching/exceeding my maximum 144hz display even at native 4K, That is not the case as the game is hard locked at 30 FPS with no reasonable mod being available to increase or unlock it. From what I gathered it has something to do with the game engine itself and that is a hard limit if you want any sense of stability or practicality,
-Game optimization is inherently poor. I played on my Ryzen 7 7700X with a RX 7900 XT & 32 GB of DDR5 6000 CL 30 on a high speed PCIE 4.0 NVME SSD. My performance utilization showed that all of my components were barely breaking a sweat as expected. Yet somehow there was more than a few odd dips of the frame rate hitting into the mid 20s periodcally. Clearly something with the coding or game engine is horribly unoptimized. I know even today Square Enix has a reputation for delivering rather lackluster PC ports but come on... 
-I really hate Blitzball.
-I do not like the sphere grid system. It initially comes comes off as very unintuitive & the game does a crappy job explaining it. While it clearly was an experiment, I found it to be very time consuming, complex, unforgiving, & grindy(and not in a good way with too many wasted empty slots). 
-Very random difficulty spikes. Some of my game overs were just due to literally bad luck and my entire squad could get wiped out without even giving me an opurtunity to react. Save spheres were often few and far between & even with taking time to grind I had more than a few close calls.
-Unskippable cut scenes that were quite long, and almost always set to play before a string of difficult back to back to back boss fights adding even more insult to injury. Infuriating. 
-While generally a pro, the English voice acting at times was just awful. I suspect most of that was due to some weird voice conversion errors as sometimes it seemed like they would play the voice line but at x5 speed. Very poorly done at times and jarring.
-Some of these temple trials were conjured up by lunatics. Seemed like nothing but time wasting padding and the puzzles range from annoying to insane. 

Despite my criticisms, I do think that this game is worth playing. I can understand now why its held up with the hype its carried even all these years later, something that I do not think the passage of time can change, Its a story that will probably hold up in my mind & while it has its lows it has some very high highs. Give it a shot, or if its been a long time, give it another play through. I know I will.",True,Strategy

Some of the great twists and revelations come in this game.",True,Strategy
FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"I cannot stress this enough -- this game is worth every penny. FFX alone is worth every penny. Add in FFX-2, which is fun in its own way, as well as The Last Mission, which is completely different but still fun, and this remaster is a great deal.

So first, FFX. It is THE quintessential turn-based JRPG, in my opinion. The story is absolutely, gut-wrenchingly stellar, the battle system is incredibly innovative, the cinematics are gorgeous, and the remaster kicked that all up a notch. And the soundtrack, my God. It is my favorite videogame OST of all time. And this is something else the remaster did, they used it as an opportunity to revamp the OST with an orchestra. Of course, you can toggle between the classic and the remastered. Words of wisdom for first-time players, though: make sure you save often, and if you're out farming EXP, make sure you have at least one party member with Ribbon!

Now, for FFX-2. I had a lot of fun with this game, even back when it came out. It trades the turn-based battle system for a more action turn-based with action gauges, which for me was not as good. The story is a continuation of FFX, but mostly with characters -- the plot is only roughly a sequel. You use dress spheres as a sort of class, and each one has its forte. There are many to unlock, so you won't get bored. The Blitzball minigame from FFX got a complete rehaul that sucks, but the other minigames, such as the coin strategy game, are fun. There's a decent amount of content.

The Last Mission is so weird, but again, fun. It's a turn-based dungeon crawler where every move matters. As you make your way around the map, each move triggers enemy monsters' moves and/or attacks. There are 100 floors to complete, with bosses every so often. If you're trying to complete all 100 floors, I recommend looking at a tip guide. The Berserker dress sphere is very helpful, but there are a couple of others that are almost essential, as well.

Bottom line: buy this. It's 2.5 games in one, and each one is well worth the asking price. If you can grab it on sale, all the better.",True,Strategy

FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"I simply cannot leave a negative review for FFX, but yes, this is a very bad port. Maybe one of squenix's worse ports. Some games you just go to steam library and click play, let me tell you all I run for this game specifically.

Special K (Project X)
Lossless Scaling
DsHidMini
DS4 Windows
JoyToKey
Lightshot

I should mention that only Project X is necessary but Lossless Scaling with LSFG 3.0 makes the game look actually smooth and not choppy (i.e. This is a 30fps game and LSFG 3.0 does frame generation to make it look 60fps). LSFG still struggles a bit with stairs though but everything else is good. There are other frame generation programs out there that are free unlike Lossless Scaling btw.

DsHidMini and DS4 Windows is to get my ps2 controller working with steam games (ps2 to usb adapter).

Lightshot and JoyToKey is because I couldn't get Special K's screenshot to work with FFX (I mapped L3 to printscreen).
Also, in Special K you can go x2 speed or more without speeding the music, I have that mapped to Select + R2.

To top this all off I had to install some mods to fix character models, Tidus' face and hair just being absolutely atrocious. Just go to Nexus mods.

If you don't use at least Project X you will have green screen cutscenes and probably crashes, you may need to update Project X if you have an older version because I think the older version didn't have the 4GB patch. I wanted to mention all these things I use in case newcomers want to optimise their experience with this port further.",True,Strategy
FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"The whole package is dollar per hour worth it, wait for a sale, it's a bit sappy but like it's a fairly linear and approachable entry for Final Fantasy.

Not blitz ball, always go look up a guide before you lose the first match enabling manual movment makes the sport way more fun and managable.",True,Strategy

In my childhood I would hear this game's battle theme pretty often because my brother is a big FFX fan and completed it multiple times.. because of that even 'To Zanarkand,' which is such a beautiful theme, is also nostalgic to me. 
Playing it now after two decades when i'm already an adult and not a little kid seeing my brother play it on the ps2 made me feel right at home but not at the same time. I knew the characters, but at the same time i didn't.. so i enjoyed getting to know them beyond the designs i remembered from long ago.
The story itself was also really good from begining to end and i think the game still holds up pretty damn well.

Gameplay wise the boss fights mainly near the end were a nightmare to go through and made me wonder how did children beat the game in the early 2000s but i digress lol, guess i just got skill issued by them.

[b]👥 Characters & Story: 9/10[/b]
The cast is fantastic, with well-developed, colorful personalities. The game nails the feeling of camaraderie—you’re not just on a quest; you’re on an adventure with friends. Tidus’ journey is emotional, filled with love, hope, and sacrifice. Even knowing parts of the story going in, it still hit hard.

[b]⚽ Blitzball: 8/10[/b]
I went in expecting a cutscene. Instead, I got an entire in-game sport. Whether you love or hate it, the fact that they programmed an entire minigame with its own mechanics is insane.

[b]🕹️ Gameplay & Combat: 7/10[/b]
Classic turn-based combat with a unique sphere grid progression system. Some fights, though, feel pretty unfair—bosses get multiple moves while you’re stuck taking turns. Late-game enemies also have ridiculously inflated HP, leading to unnecessary grinding.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
[i]Final Fantasy X[/i] is a classic for a reason. Even with its old-school mechanics and occasional difficulty spikes, it’s an unforgettable journey with a great story, fantastic music, and some of the most memorable characters in gaming. Highly recommended.

[b]✔️ Pros:[/b]
✅ Amazing soundtrack
✅ Memorable characters & story
✅ Strong sense of adventure and friendship
✅ Blitzball is surprisingly deep

[b]❌ Cons:[/b]
⏳ Some unnecessary grinding
⚔️ Bosses can feel unfair
🏋️ Enemy HP bloat in later sections

FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,Two timeless classics. A must have for any JRPG enthusiast.,True,Strategy
FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"I bought the first Final Fantasy in a store.  It came in a box.  I got many hours of enjoyment out of it, and later the rest of the games in the series, but I never got around to playing anything past Final Fantasy 8.  Recently I picked them up, and Final Fantasy 9 was a nice throwback to the older games, with some new concepts.  I was advised that Final Fantasy 10 is even better, one of the all-time greats, so I was looking forward to playing it.

This  game straight-up sucks.

It is a series of interminable, unskippable cut scenes interspersed with save points.  The level progression system might not be completely incomprehensible, but I'll never know because I won't sit through twenty minutes of spreadsheet tutorials. 
 They've turned the skill tree into some kind of Parcheesi clone where you have to minmax several kinds of arbitrary resources.   I solved this by ignoring it completely.  This decision had no detectable repercussions.

Whoever designed the main minigame (""blitzball"") has read about fun in books but has never experienced it directly.  There are twelve pages of online help for playing this ""minigame,"" none of which matter, because things just happen at random until you are returned to the next fifteen-minute cut scene.  

In between cut scenes, there are occasional fights, but there appear to be about six types of enemy, which just sort of repeat.  Some of the enemies require magic to defeat, which just makes the boring combat system drag on even further, because you have to wait for a magic user's turn.  I guess it doesn't matter that the fights are repetitive and the combat system is not fun, because once the fight ends you're just going to get another cut scene.

I gave up six hours in.  To that point there was no exploration, no meaningful decisions to make, nothing anyone said made any sense, and the game still hadn't got round to having a plot.  I'm not even sure 'game' is a good word for it.  It's more like a really crappy cartoon that makes you walk for fifteen seconds between scenes.  We're given absolutely no reason to care about any character in the game, which is for the best because nothing interesting happens to anyone.  

So if what is missing from your life is D-grade melodrama interspersed with tons of accounting homework, this is the cartoon for you.  If you're looking to play a video game, the Final Fantasy series ended at IX.  This one is so bad I'm not even going to try the rest of them.

P.S.  This version comes with a feature where you can set the game to run at 2x speed [i]but the setting doesn't affect the cut scenes[/i].  The [i]unskippable[/i] cut scenes.  I find this hilarious and congratulate the devs on their sense of irony.",False,Strategy

The game has a nice amount of single player content, which give some neat stuff like more characters (only the non DLC ones), maps, home panels and dice. The online, however, is where you'll spend most of your time, and it has a pretty welcoming community. It also has a pretty good co-op mode, but it's less populated.

X-Morph: Defense,"If you like base/tower defense in rts style with a hero this is your game :)                                                                                X-Morph: Defense is basically the counter game to Anomaly: Warzone Earth. You're part of an alien invasion force, which's goal it is to gather the ressources of Earth, and must defend your Core structures in 14 levels from human attacks.

Like the game description and screenshots already tell, this is a tower defense game, where you actively participate in the fight. You're controlling an alien ship, which can switch between attack mode and ghost mode on the fly, whereby the ghost mode is both a defense mode and your building mode.

The ship itself hast four attacks. A rapid fire dual plasma gun, bombs, anti air rockets and a laser beam, which all offer a secondary fire option. The Plasma gun can be charged to fore a single plasma ball, the bombs can be charged to the Dark Matter bombs, which can destryo buildings, the Rockets offer an EMP attack and the laser creates an anti gravity hole, which is basically a block hole that instantly destroys most enemies. During combat, your ship can be damaged, but also regens health when being out of combat. This also goes for the ghost mode, which makes you invincible, but disables your weapons.

To the gameplay itself: Each level starts with your Core landing on Earth and you have to defend it from waves of attacks, which become harder the longer the level goes on. At the start of each round and between waves, you have an unlimited amount of time to place defense turrets. Like the ships, these turrets have various weapons. Each turret starts with a plasma cannon, but can be upgraded to wield flamethrowers, artillery guns, lasers and anti air weapons.

The amounts of turrets and upgrades you can build is limited by a ressource meter, which is filled up by beating a wave, killing enemies or collecting their scrap with a ship upgrade. Additionally to their weapons, turrets also have impassable laser fences, which can be used to block off enemy routes, so that it takes more time for them to reach your Core and to funnel mutliple enemies into a choke point. Between the waves and during combat, turrets can be relocated and reconfigurated. For example, if you fought of a bunch of bombers and now a group of soldiers is walking along the turret during the next wave, you can change the anti air gun into the flamethrower free of charge. Relocating turrets is also free and you also get your spent ressources back, if one of your turrets gets destroyed, which makes the game player friendly.

The enemies are a slightly futuristic, global army, which resemble the GDI from Command and Conquer. They have tanks, APCs, helicopters, fighter jets, anti air units and other vehicles, which all are serving different purposes. Tanks for example, just attack your core, anti air vehicles are serving as a medic unit and attack the placer, APCs deploy infantry units if not destroyed and bombers target your structures on their flight path. Additionally to that, the game also has three boss enemies, which all work a bit differently and bring a small bullet hell element into the game.",True,Strategy

4. During defense planning , able to fight with Quadruple physical technologies. (like Gravity hole and EMP bomb)
5. after finishing the waves , you will challenge with heavy armored bosses. (this is literally addictive and fun as hell.)

Debris is next to worthless in the grander scheme of a match & it is bullshit it is an ability we even have to unlock. 

Weapon targeting priority is just awful – It has NO consistency to what it targets when you are using weapons like the laser & your AA defense just randomly stops targeting an incoming bomber for the fighter-escort that can’t even do anything to it. 

The 3 bosses I’ve fought are a scale of just mid. 
Tarantula iterations were both fun. It is a solid, well designed hitbox boss and its gimmick works. The Jaguar sucks. Its hitboxes just don’t work to such a point that your AOE attacks can do the most ball-tickling damage if it isn’t perfectly on the pixel. 
The big aircraft thing improved on the hitbox issue of the Jaguar but there was just. too. much. Holy fuck learn what FUN is.

The fact that each mission is the exact same narrative flow of “aliens landed, rally!!!! Im SenDinG In mOrE TaNKs” like at some point you have just made your opponent so dumb there isn’t any satisfaction in beating them. After Germany the matches should just spawn with double & triple, with the starting resources to match – show PROGRESSION in what we are doing

Paths just randomly change to with no justification as to why.

Terraria,"A potentially good game. I say that because if it's you're first time playing the game, I suggest you play solo or with other players who have the same level of experience as you.

As a beginner playing with veterans, early game is just a blur. With you fumbling around and trying to figure things out. While your more experienced friends start exploring the world at a fast pace. By mid game, you just feel left out and the game becomes more or less unrewarding. Most of the easily accessible chests have already been opened and all ""limited"" loot in the world have already been taken.

Picture this. Your friends flying in the are dawning shiny armor and weapons with cool effects while you still wear the basic craftable armor and craftable weapon. And every time you explore and come across a chest, expecting to finally get some cool loot yourself. Only to open it and find it empty. Not fun at all.

It's not until mid to late game where you start getting the hang of things and start to feel useful and maybe get some good loot here and there. -- At the cost of extensively reading the wiki to bridge the gap in experience so you somehow know what you want to do and have your own personal goal.

Pros
- Lots of different weapons
- Dynamic environment - random events, biomes spreading, etc
- Interactive and unique NPCs
- Lots of blocks, building and decorative pieces

Cons
- Bosses are terribly unbalanced with multiplayer
- Some lootable items have a limit to how many there are in the world
- World size limit

Terraria,"Terraria is one of the most creative and addictive sandbox games ever made. It combines exploration, building, and combat in a 2D world filled with endless possibilities. At first glance, some people might compare it to Minecraft, but Terraria offers a unique experience with its deep progression system, challenging bosses, and rich world-building.

One of the best things about Terraria is its sense of adventure. Players start with basic tools and must gather resources to survive. As they dig deeper underground, they discover valuable ores, hidden treasures, and dangerous enemies. The game constantly rewards exploration, making every new cave or biome exciting to discover. From dark dungeons to glowing mushroom forests, the variety of environments keeps the game fresh.

Combat in Terraria is another highlight. The game has a wide range of weapons, from swords and bows to magic spells and futuristic laser guns. Each weapon feels different, allowing players to develop their own playstyle. The boss fights are especially intense and require skill, strategy, and good equipment. Defeating bosses unlocks new items and materials, pushing players to keep progressing.

Building is also a major part of Terraria. Players can design and customize their own houses, castles, or even entire cities. The game offers hundreds of decorative items, furniture, and blocks to create unique structures. NPCs move into the player’s town as they progress, offering useful items and services. This system makes the world feel alive and encourages players to expand their settlements.

Terraria is a game that never gets boring. With its deep progression, challenging combat, and limitless creativity, it offers something for everyone. Whether playing solo or with friends, the game provides an unforgettable adventure filled with surprises. Even after hundreds of hours, there’s always something new to discover, making it a true masterpiece of the sandbox genre.

The best part is the ability to play with friends! You can explore the world together, making it even more fun. The graphics are cute and pixelated, while the music helps set the atmosphere.

Updates make the game even more interesting by adding new features and items (it's a shame they come out very rarely). Overall, Terraria is a great entertaining experience for those who love adventure and creativity.

The game is worth the money spent on it!
RU: 
Terraria — это игра, где ты можешь исследовать большой мир, строить свои дома и сражаться с врагами.

Когда ты начинаешь, у тебя есть только несколько простых инструментов. Ты можешь добывать ресурсы, делать оружие и броню, а также создавать вещи для своего дома. В игре много разных мест, где можно находить сюрпризы, боссов и уникальных врагов, что делает игру очень разнообразной!

Самое классное — это возможность играть с друзьями! Можно вместе исследовать мир, делая это еще веселее. Графика в игре милая и пиксельная, а музыка помогает погрузиться в атмосферу.

Обновления делают игру ещё более интересной, добавляя новые фишки и предметы(печально, что они выходят очень редко). В общем, Terraria — это отличное развлечение для тех, кто любит приключения и творчество.

In the past months that I've had the game I haven't played it often, but I'm starting to get into and play the game more now.
I love games with pixel or

The game has loads of content and features to explore and a ton of settings to be adjusted to your taste/needs, as well as multiplayer functionality, both over IP and Steam.

If you are on the fence, get it. You won't regret it. (Just don't forget to wait for a sale if theres one coming soon.0)",True,Strategy
Terraria,"Better than Minecraft

In all seriousness. This game has been really addicting. No other game rewards you for exploring the area around you and trying new things as much as this game. It has great combat, unique game mechanics, and a solid and stable progression system to keep you engaged and keeping it from getting stale.

With hundreds of weapons, 4 different classes, over a handful of well designed bosses, thousand of blocks to inspire creativity, this game offers thousands of hours worth of replayability, and it has a cheap cost compared to many AAA titles, what's not to love? And if you don't like the base game, for one reason or another. There is a gigantic modding community out there constantly working on fantastic mods that can fulfill whatever it is you want. Anywhere from quality of life mods, to texture and music packs, to crazy content mods that change the game completely, and even some exotic mods like one that makes the entire game 3D.

Along with that, this is one of the very few games out there that have stood the test of time. It has a nice and active dev team that have been working on this game as a passion project for years. Always listening to the community and updating every couple months to add new content, occasionally doing collaborations with other great games.
 
Do beware though, that playing this game is a investment you must be willing to go through. At the start, it will be frustrating to figure out what is going on and what to do, along with a lack of tutorial, which is a turn off for a lot of people. So I recommend you bring a friend who knows the game or watch a video about it. But as you gain knowledge, you will create your own unique solutions to overcome your in-game obstacles throughout your playthrough, and you will end up having a lot more fun.

I really hope this review is convincing enough to get you to try the game out for yourself. If so, I hope you enjoy the game as much as the rest of us in the community do. :)

Terraria,"This game is sick. My personal reason for playing this many hours in the game is I love the character progression. There's always a power upgrade to be playing for, whether it's more damage, more defense, more mobility, more quality of life; it always feels like you're getting stronger and have a goal to grind for, until those mobs that gave you trouble in the beginning end up crumbling before you as you blink around the map one shotting everything. 

If you like RPG character progression in a sandbox 2D environment, this is your game for sure. Oh, and theres a ton of stuff you can build if you're into making your base look cool. My bases always look like crap though.

**Disclaimer: This game does have a pretty high skill floor, even now I have the wiki open (NOT THE FANDOM WIKI!!!) on my 2nd monitor when I'm playing. I wouldn't recommend playing with friends who already know what to do, as you'll probably end up getting dragged along without enjoying the magic of finding treasure yourself.",True,Strategy
Terraria,"I love how this game handled progression, the developers were very intentional  about how the player can navigate the map and the concept of the world changing as the player completes certain milestones is great.

You can do numerous different playthroughs with different classes or just play freely. Usually people call this 2d minecraft, but as someone who loves both games they are not comparable. This game is complex with loads of content, weapons, accessories, costumes, building materials & more.

Terraria,"This is the kind of game that sticks with you for life. I played it when I was little, and it left such an impression on me that I’ve never stopped coming back to it. Whether it's nostalgia or the pure quality of the experience, there's something about this game that makes it so incredibly special.

If you're looking for a gaming experience that will captivate you for 10 to 20 hours, this is a title you simply cannot miss. It doesn't matter if the game is at full price – the value you get from it far exceeds its cost. The gameplay is rich,  and the world is crafted with such care that you’ll find yourself lost in it every time you play.

What makes this game even more remarkable is how well it holds up over time. Sure, gaming technology and graphics have evolved, but this title stands as a testament to timeless game design. Every time I revisit it, I find myself rediscovering things that I missed, or appreciating mechanics I hadn't fully understood as a kid.

If you're in search of a game that delivers depth, replayability, and a sense of true joy, this is the one. Don’t hesitate to pick it up, no matter the price – this is the kind of game that sticks with you long after you’ve finished it. It’s a guaranteed good time, and a game you’ll want to return to again and again.",True,Strategy

Sure, like Minecraft you start off with nothing and can place blocks to build anything you imagine. But in the meantime, in Terraria you can gather materials to build one of hundreds of weapons or one of dozens of armor sets. You can go to different biomes to fight unique enemies that drop gear to help you on your journey. There are many boss fights that when defeated help you progress through the game, and some can even permanently change the world. You can even create your own biomes! You can build a village to house NPCs that each have unique needs and sell unique items. You can fish, golf, build a computer, build a mob farm, grind for good rolls on gear, and so on. It never gets boring, and each playthrough is unique. Definitely give this game a shot! You won't regret it.",True,Strategy

However, I immediately became obsessed. There is so much to do and explore in Terreria! I love the building mechanics, the awesome weapons, and the endless amount of crafting and upgrading. Adventuring and fighting is so much fun in this game. Since upgrades and new weapons are pretty easy to get, the fighting isn't that bad. Of course there are still bosses, but it's not as rage-inducing as I thought it might be! Fighting the bosses is also more fun. I also love the soundtrack. I also like the fishing in this game. I usually hate fishing in games because it's a bit difficult, but this was pretty simple to do. Whenever I look at the wiki, I am blown away by how much more this is to do and see. 10/10 recommend!",True,Strategy
Terraria,"I definitely have a few misgivings about the game which I'll list here, but given how great the game is overall, I definitely recommend it.

The game is fairly tough for new players to sink their teeth into. It can be hard to find direction for the first few hours.
In particular, if the guide dies without a house to move back into, it's very hard for a new player to know what to do. His ""Help"" dialogue is the entire extent of the game's tutorial.

Once you beat that hurdle and start downing bosses, the game quickly picks up its pace and becomes an excellent sandbox RPG. If combat isn't your thing and you want to focus on the sandbox elements, there's a decent amount for you to do, but you'll quickly hit a wall where you need to down bosses to reach some of the more interesting tools. It's definitely more combat-focused than Minecraft.

The early to mid game definitely feels the most polished mechanics-wise. Once you're in the late game, however, the variety of movement tools starts to be diminished by how dominantly powerful wings are. Many of the boss attacks start to become more visually cluttering (looking at you Queen Slime), but they have done a decent job controlling that outside a few bad examples.

The super-late game also feels a bit rushed, although the final boss is a great sendoff.

I have been loving the new updates, and the devs very evidently have a lot of love for their game. Don't let my criticism dissuade you - I wanted to keep this concise, so I trimmed down my heaps of praise.",True,Strategy

Terraria,"What separates Terraria from other sandbox survival crafters for me is the sheer variety in weapons, armour and items and how fun it all feels to use and discover. 

Weapons in other survival crafters can often feel really basic (you'll use a sword, or a bow, sometimes a staff and these can all be upgraded to be functionally the same but do more damage). Terraria goes above and beyond with item variety - you can use bows that rain blood from the sky, staffs that have projectiles that follow your cursor, miniguns with ricocheting bullets, swords that create lava explosions, bombs, traps, crossbows, spears, summoned minions. There are items for everything, accessories that can help you build, make a garden with boots that grow plants wherever you run, accessories for combat, movement, construction. However you want to play, the game lets you.

The game can start off slow and actually has a bit of a learning (and discovery) curve because the guidance resources inside the game can be a bit ambiguous, if you don't like using outside resources you can miss a lot of things (which is completely fine), obviously being a sandbox game you can approach it whatever way works.

The amount of item content is massively ridiculous. It would also be a massive pain to play without the wiki. Certain mods (Recipe manager) are also highly recommended. So you may also want to grab tModloader (free).

There really is no story, but there are 24 NPCs (mostly for buying stuff) and bosses (14) and world progression (3 stages of change). I am very impressed by the world generation algorithms.

Atomic Heart,"[b] Atomic Heart [/b] can be described as a budget version of Cyberpunk 2077 – the atmosphere is definitely there, but the limitations of the developers in terms of budget and storytelling are clearly visible. On top of that, the game got caught up in political controversies, which led to harsher reviews from critics. As a result, it lost many potential players and, with them, a significant part of its potential profit.

Despite this, Atomic Heart is a game full of contrasts, where its strong points make up for some of its flaws. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of teleportation and a limited open world that doesn’t encourage exploration due to the absence of side quests or extra elements to discover. The main missions are rather simple and lead the player by the hand, but this is balanced by challenging logic puzzles. These puzzles can be frustrating at times, but solving them is very satisfying.

A big advantage of the game is its unique style, set in an alternate Soviet reality. Both the machines and the cities shown in cutscenes impress with their detailed design, creating a very atmospheric world. Unfortunately, other locations, where players spend most of their time, feel empty and generic, lacking any special features to stand out. Another highlight is the excellent Polish localization, which was a very pleasant surprise and significantly improved my experience.

The developers are also actively supporting the game by regularly adding new expansions, which expand the world of Atomic Heart and provide additional hours of gameplay. Despite its flaws, the game is an interesting experience that’s definitely worth checking out.",True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"This is one of the best looking, worst feeling games I have ever played. There is not a single thing in this game that feels satisfying or fun to do. The waste of potential here is like nothing I've ever seen. Some game designers truly live on a different planet than the rest of us...",False,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"After all the rumors that accompanied the game before its release that it was not really there because the trailers were too good, in the end everything turned out to be true - the game turned out great. Setting, style, music, graphics, locations, cutscenes, monsters, plot, dialogues, lore, humor, shooting and game mechanics. It has everything, from good to excellent.

Atomic Heart,"Most disappointed I've ever been after purchasing a game. I was so excited to play this game after seeing the trailers, and I really tried to enjoy it. The art style of the game is actually really cool and some areas of the map look really cool, however that's the one praise I have for this game. This graphics and animations are terrible, really buggy at times. Combat is really unresponsive with enemies barely reacting to being hit. Most of the puzzles are really boring and just feel like a chore to do. As for the story, it feels like they gave up midway through development and decided to end it. The game just abruptly ends with a choice of two of the most unsatisfying endings I've ever experienced. After you complete the story (which won't take you very long), you get placed back in the ""open world"" in which there is literally nothing to do unless you haven't explored some of the underground facilities. 90% of the game is just unengaging puzzles, leading to zero replayability. A large portion of this game's community is also incapable of taking criticism of the game's state and seem to be in a state of denial about how bad this game actually is, do not waste your money buying this.",False,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"[h3]Pros:[/h3]
-Striking visual design and art direction
-Atmospheric setting reminiscent of Dishonored

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
-Gameplay becomes repetitive after the initial hours
-First-person combat mechanics feel awkward and imprecise
-Dialogues are cheesy and lack depth
-Puzzles feel more tedious than rewarding

[h3]Initial Impressions:[/h3]
I tried the demo for Atomic Heart and was immediately impressed by its stunning opening sequence and immersive atmosphere, which reminded me of Dishonored’s blend of retro-futuristic style and grand world-building. The demo left such a strong impression that I decided to purchase the full game right away.

[h3]Gameplay & Mechanics:[/h3]
Unfortunately, after about four hours, the experience started feeling repetitive. While the first-person perspective works well for exploration, it felt clunky during high-intensity maneuvers—particularly the 360-degree spinning attack, which never quite clicked.

[h3]Story & Dialogue:[/h3]
One of the biggest letdowns was the dialogue. The writing often came across as cheesy, with characters speaking abruptly—as if they were just filling space rather than pushing the story or character development forward.

[h3]Puzzles:[/h3]
By the eight-hour mark, the game introduced more puzzles, but they felt neither satisfying nor rewarding. They came off as time-consuming diversions rather than meaningful challenges. These sections only added to my growing frustration.

[h3]Overall Experience:[/h3]
Ultimately, I uninstalled the game. Despite its gorgeous visuals and intriguing premise, Atomic Heart didn’t hold my interest due to repetitive gameplay, awkward combat mechanics, and lackluster writing. While some players may find the setting and style appealing enough to push through, it fell short of expectations for me.

Atomic Heart,"Amazing game. This game combined everything I like: combat, exploration (in assumption that game is not open-world), puzzles and etc. Everything I listed is not ideal, but very good. Music and sounds are excelent, I was and will continue listen it. Art and graphics are stunning. Even optimization is well done, especially knowing that this is Unreal Engine 5. I will definetly recommend this game for all FPS lovers.",True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"🎮 Overall Rating: 9/10
✅ Pros:
✔ Incredible World-Building – The retro-futuristic Soviet setting is stunning, filled with immersive environments and breathtaking visuals. The art direction is a major highlight.
✔ Engaging Combat – The mix of melee, ranged weapons, and abilities (like telekinesis and shock) makes for dynamic and fun battles. Enemy AI is aggressive, keeping you on your toes.
✔ Deep Lore & Story – A mix of mystery, sci-fi, and dystopian themes keeps the narrative intriguing, with unexpected twists.
✔ Impressive Soundtrack – The music, composed by Mick Gordon (DOOM series), enhances the intensity of fights and exploration.
✔ Variety of Enemies & Bosses – Unique enemy designs and challenging boss fights make encounters thrilling.

❌ Cons:
❌ Weak Writing & Dialogue – Some lines feel awkward or forced, and the protagonist's attitude can be off-putting.
❌ Technical Issues – Occasional bugs, FPS drops, and performance hiccups, especially at launch.
❌ Pacing & Open-World Limitations – While the world looks great, exploration can feel empty at times, with too much backtracking.
❌ Stealth Feels Useless – Despite being an option, stealth mechanics are not well-developed compared to direct combat.

⚖ Final Verdict:
Atomic Heart delivers an unforgettable experience with its rich setting, intense combat, and unique world. While it has flaws in writing and some technical rough edges, the gameplay and atmosphere make it a must-play for FPS and immersive sim fans. If you enjoy games like Bioshock or DOOM, this one is worth picking up.

Atomic Heart,"Just finished Atomic Heart (except DLC, looking forward to that) ... man, what a game. So misunderstood. Yeah it's a bit janky and unfinished* in some ways, but it's super creative, visually stunning, and so satisfying to play. I usually don't like fighting robots OR zombies, but these ones are a blast. Gunplay and melee both feel great thanks to visual and auditory feedback. The sound in general is amazing, as well as the MUSIC. First soundtrack I've ever listened to outside of a game, besides Donkey Kong Country.

Hilarious to me that people denounced it as 'communist propaganda' when it is very anti-communist. And the main character is SUPPOSED to be a cringey macho action hero, based on the story. Besides, what's up with gamers expecting all characters to be ""likeable?"" Haven't they watched, like... Always Sunny? The writing does get repetitive towards the end if you've been reading all the terminals and 'chirpers'... but they needed to make sure the beeliners understood the story, too.

*To clarify ""janky and unfinished"" ...
1) Overlapping/interruptable dialogue (can often be avoided by standing still whenever dialogue starts so you don't trigger the next lines).
2) Getting stuck on terrain and/or blocked by things you should realistically be able to climb over or slip past. I hope the next game has more fluid and open-ended movement in general.
3) Fair bit of 'sameyness' to the level design, despite some incredible themes and set pieces. Obviously the open world was unfinished but I didn't mind that as much as others.

My main complaint is the game was much too easy on the highest difficulty if you've been upgrading things, collecting resources, and know how to dash (I LOVE the dash though). I'm sure you could make it even easier by spamming abilities and using heavy weapons, but I did not. I tried to challenge myself by focusing mainly on charged melee attacks and the 3-shot pistol. Didn't use any of the elemental weapon modifiers, grenade launcher etc. Also limited myself to the small healing items. Ended up with dozens of medium and large ones in my inventory at the end of the game. Tons of ammo leftover, too. Never had to craft anything. Did my best to make it hard to no avail. Wish I could play it more like an FPS soulslike ... the i-frame dash gets you nearly there.

Some might complain about the save system but I love that it encourages you to take your mistakes in stride. Unlike Bioshock and Prey where you can find yourself save scumming to phony perfection.

Altogether a worthy successor to Bioshock and Prey (2017). I just played both of those last year, so I can make a fresh comparison. Really hope the developers get to make more games, and have a bit more time/resources to polish them up.",True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"Overall I enjoyed Atomic Hearts, even if my first run was on Armageddon. Story was pretty decent, as were the set pieces and overall combat. Enemies can be a bit spongy at times, and while I was initially a bit annoyed with all the “Crispy Critters” being mentioned, eventually warmed up to it. Overall, great game with a banger soundtrack. I'm am looking forward to see what they do next in the sequel.",True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"My wife made some delicious air fried snacks while watching me play this game and we have now officially dubbed them crispy critters. 

Atomic Heart is a very enjoyable game, overall smooth combat, very intriguing and twisting story, and an awesome soundtrack. Immediate comparisons in my mind are a ""Russian bioshock"" in both combat and theme, but its definitely got its own identity as well. The world building in this game is very high quality and consistent for the most part.

The game has a surprising amount of depth between skills/upgrades, weapon customization, semi-open world segments to explore, and a large amount of dialogue that is actually pretty funny and interesting to listen to. 

I was expecting a casual run through to experience the story but now I really want to try out the DLC's to see the rest. 

My only issues with the game are the open world segments...constant patrols and so many alarm mechanics make it feel like a roided out Far Cry with no end to enemies, so its a bit of a slog to try and explore. After trying a few times I opted to just zoom to my objectives instead.",True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"For a game who came out after 2020. This feels like it has a SOUL... For now (1.8h play time).

Not many games know how to make a proper introduction to their game and many fear of what people will think about the realistic vulgar dialogues, yet they made the game feel like it has a soul, because it looks like it was built with passion, without fear of being judged for their real life dialogue reproductions. No BS, just real human talk.

I prefer playing lesser known games because they tend to have great content and a SOUL given by the dev team, and this is one of the higher budget ones I've seen to clearly affirm a modern gaming experience.



Raytracing barely seem to make a difference except decreasing overall performance by 60%+. Performance is great without it (with some graphic optimization). i7-12700k, 32gbRAM, RTX3080 at 1440p avg 140-240fps.












Edit once completed on medium difficulty:

- Final boss was almost the worst in the game.
- Fps is divided by 3 when outside.
- Exploration doesn't bring much power to your armament (Polygons)
- Electric pistol is really fun to use. I really enjoy having a kind of limited usage elemental weapon with a slow-mid recovery, it's not busted and really helps saving on ammo when needed. Using electricity is always fun no matter what.

- Lockpicking was a bit too much the same rythm one and barely any of which you needed a combination to unlock, which could've rewarded exploration.
- Repair drones are a plague.
- THE PRODUCTION QUALITY DEFINITELY STARTED GOING DOWNHILL FROM THE SECOND HALF.
- The credits were very long and should've went with dual or triple columns instead of staking everyone on top of each others, 20+mins credits are annoying to sit through when you've seen a few games rewarding the player with an achievement to sit through it and always do it ever since.


-There's too much heals and they're too easy to craft. I ended with 30+ heals and never used large heals, maybe it's just my skills but they shouldn't be that easy to get em'.
- I don't understand the hate for it's design choices and graphical style. It's perfectly fine in modern standards, not everything needs to be colorful and hyper stylish... Some gameplay features minor brain usage and it's apparently too much for some to handle. If you can't play without constant giveaways, just skip this one. It's not gonna give you everything spoonfed and cooked.

The ""open world"" is good but there is WAY too many enemies.

Music is a solid 9/10, they did an incredible job with the OST

By the time you get to the cool shit, you are so far beyond giving one. The puzzles that are introduced build on this tedium and frustration.

Atomic Heart,"This is one of the few games I have actually managed to finish and today I did (albeit on Easy difficulty).  I have to say I was very impressed by the graphical detail and quality.  The story was good enough to hook me in and make me want to keep going to see the ending (the final fight was quite spectacular).
After a few freezes I found the solution in my case was simply to lower the FPS cap to 144.  I really like FPS/adventure/puzzle games like Half-Life and Bioshock, so Atomic Heart did not disappoint.  In fact there is a direct reference to the first Bioshock game when Sergey is descending in the elevator from the lighthouse to the undersea part of the complex.  I think it's obvious that the devs were inspired / influenced by Bioshock.
One thing I would suggest for the devs is, for God's sake, please optimise the climbing / jumping mechanism to make it easier for the player.  I had more problems with this than anything else in this game, especially in the various Testing Grounds.  I also had weapons problems - couldn't use certain weapons even when I equipped them in the Player Storage screen.
I really don't understand all the negative reviews on STEAM.  I had a great time with Atomic Heart and now thinking about buying the Game Pass to play the DLCs, if and when it goes on sale.",True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"Even without the myriad glitches this game is not fun. The robots are bland, the story is bleak and does not even introduce itself in a good way, You just start as though there was a preestablished story you are supposed to be aware of. The characters are drab and the little quips they try to add in are repetitive and often fall flat.

The gameplay is wonky; climbing things is not fluid and often feels blocky, with no clear indication of where you are supposed to climb to proceed. Combat is fun at first but also becomes tedious and repetitive. The overworld is boring and things are either too close together or too far apart. The map itself is not very useful as the text labeling things is often difficult to read and moving the cursor around is way too slow for my taste. With no compass, it is very easy to lose your sense of direction which is frustrating when you are wandering around being spotted by oddly placed camera drones and then gunned/sawed down by sneaky robots. The option to skip through dialogue is also very poorly designed in that it sort of super fast forwards the speech and then randomly speeds through the written text, forcing to either listen at the games natural pace or skip it entirely (I like to read and skip as I finish each sentence, which this doesn't allow you to do), so what is the point of being allowed to skip? Just don't talk to the optional NPC's at all then...

Now on to the glitches. Getting stuck on/in the terrain ruins and sense of exploration. Picking up key quest items and having them stuck on your left hand without the quest marker updating makes it impossible to proceed with the main story. I was ""lucky"" enough to have a previous save that I was able to restart the first few times this happened, but after almost 20 hours in I got the glitch again when retrieving a certain head that kept registering as an ammo pickup and no longer had a previous save far enough back to load up (the game auto-deletes after so many saves). Some minor glitches that wouldn't have necessarily ruined the game were things like odd/mislabeled dialogue or dialogue being interrupted and either resuming over and over or not at all.",False,Strategy

I can't wait to see what they do next.,True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"An ambitious and visually striking game that delivers a unique blend of retro-futuristic Soviet aesthetics, intense combat, and a bizarre, yet intriguing, world. From the moment you step into its alternate-history USSR setting, the game impresses with its rich atmosphere, detailed environments, and eerie robotic designs. The world feels both beautiful and unsettling, with an art style that stands out from most modern FPS games.

Combat is one of Atomic Heart’s strongest aspects, offering a mix of gunplay, melee combat, and special abilities powered by your polymer-enhanced glove. The powers add an interesting layer of strategy, and the variety of enemy types keeps encounters exciting. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of eerie melodies and high-energy remixes of Soviet-era music, further enhances the experience.

However, the game does stumble in several areas. The writing and dialogue can be hit-or-miss, with awkward voice acting (especially in English) and some cringeworthy lines that take away from the immersion. The open-world sections feel somewhat empty and repetitive, and the game’s pacing suffers due to excessive backtracking and long, drawn-out puzzles. Additionally, the story starts strong but loses momentum, leaving some questions unanswered.

Despite these issues, Atomic Heart is a bold and memorable experience that offers something different from the usual FPS formula. If you enjoy games with deep world-building, creative combat, and don’t mind a few rough edges, it’s worth checking out.

Atomic Heart,"Atomic Heart is a breath of fresh air among the sea of generic shooters currently on the market. It clearly takes inspiration from other games, but it doesn't feel like a clone of any of them. It has elements that remind of Half Life, Fallout, Bioshock, and Doom; but it doesn't feel like a plagiarism of them.

The design, art style, and music choices made for the soundtrack; demonstrate that care and passion was put into the game. I hope this continues to carry into any future titles the developer makes. For their first release, this hit it out of the park. 

If you're in a mood for a single player FPS experience, then I would definetly recommend Atomic Heart and its DLCs.

Meele combat is quite annoying without option to block, instead offering heavy attack, that takes ton of time to prepare. 

Pretty much onlfy freeeze skill is usefull, while remaining ones are unuseful. At least in my opinion

Lots of uncesessary complexity on all mechanics, like looting for example, where you use you glove to do telekinesis looting. In theory it should work faster, but practically, makes it more annoying, having to press and hold ""F"" button, instead just opening containter and going ""loot all"".

Lots of cutsceens for poorly direcored special effects. 

Scanning, that does not seperate livestock from mechanical enemies, marking them both es enemies.

Exploration is utterly unnoying. Every zone is secured with infinitely spawning repair bots, repairing all cameras and all the bots around.

Atomic Heart,A bit buggy but great story.,True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,Creative story line. Awesome level design. Offers many ways to achieve goals.,True,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"Atomic Heart is surprisingly a really good game and its way better than Scorn. The game reminds me more of Bioshock and a little bit of the fallout games, and the Story is pretty good too. The weapons are pretty unique, my favorite weapon is the Dominator and the AKM. the puzzles are well made, some are normal puzzles and some are physics puzzles.

Now for the negatives, I know the developers fixed most of the bugs & glitches but I had a glitch where I drank a bottle of vodka and interact with the store machine, and the motion effect on my screen was stuck permanently so I had to restart a checkpoint to fix it. One of the mission's I had to fight a horde of mutant plant zombies to wait for a key or something, and the game crashed out of no where. The Rail gun is good but if you use it on common enemies, they'll get vaporize and you won't be able to collect their resources so I ended up using the gun on bosses only. I had a lot more fun fighting robots & mutants inside of underground facilities, but I hate fighting them outside of on the surface. The Hive machine which I also hate the most keep spawning repair drones endlessly and you can't destroy it either, no matter what weapon you use.

Overall I give this game a 7.5 out of 10, I know I talked about the vodka screen glitched and the game crashed but to be fair it only happen once. This game could have been better if some of the weapons and the abilities had more of a punchy sound effect because some of them sound kind of weak, and if they add a few more weapons like an SMG, rifle & flamethrower. last If the game lets you destroy the Hive machines & disable all of the robots on the surface ""Permanently"" and not temporally, that would be great.",True,Strategy

This is a very Russian game.

After completing the game and DLC's to date 1-3 I can say this game has easily became one of my favorite open world shooters to date. The gunplay is very inspired by Bioshock along with the abilities. And the story was much better and original than I expected. There are a few minor complaints I have concerning some of the VO not matching the subtitles but that does not take away from the game itself.

The freedom of exploration and player choice is gratifying and the many types keep you interested the whole time you play. It can be a little daunting at first when you get out into the first open area (the game is setup in zone like structures, but one zone is open to the next not causing loading screens to appear every time a new area is explored, which is a huge positive in my book), but once you learn the mechanics of the enemies and surveillance systems the game is a lot of fun to be had!

Atomic Heart,"A genre-bender that really toes the line between whether you're aiding the foundation of a dystopia or saving the collapse of a utopia, with your character P-3 smacked down into the middle of it all (who has limited memory might I add). Though not always immediately clear, Atomic Heart will explain both the world and P-3's story in ways that will confuse and excite. 
The game makes it clear you're important, but to what degree requires some investigation. The lore that Mundfish was able to create in this game is incredible with plenty of terminals to be read and side conversations to be had with corpses (you'll understand) to help explain the unique and curious world P-3 lives in, and in many ways that he's also trying to understand.
I was unaware of this game and its hype before playing it so I cannot relate to what those who are disappointed in the title have to say about not fulfilling its promises- however, perhaps there is truth in that and I am ignorant to it. That being said though, this is one of my favorite, and certainly one of the most unique titles, I have played in recent memory.
I also want to commend Mundfish for their commitment to regular DLC. This game came out years ago and we still have one more promised DLC to be released. Not only that, but the DLC are priced extremely reasonably compared to similar on the market. I paid $9 for DLC in the early 2010's, doing it in 2025 is a huge deal to the player base. Even with the flop of ""Trapped in Limbo"" the DLCs as a whole remain well worth the investment for just the story alone.
I think this title will go on to be understood and appreciated more in time, even though it has been received quite well already. The score, lore, combat, and even the oft-criticized VA were all important to making this a truly enjoyable experience in my opinion.

I would not recommend this game. Just play Bioshock, System Shock, or Fallout.",False,Strategy
Atomic Heart,"so.. I was positive when going into this game. I felt like it's overhated and it doesn't deserve it, except for the drama before the release, but this review isn't about than, it's about now.

The game with how many bugs it has as you venture furher into the game feels unfinished. Enemies can glitch into the floor, break their AI, game can crash (rarely, crashed only like 2 times on Steam Deck), some items/objects can become uninteractable, blocking you out of 100%'ing the game or getting an achievement on your save, and sometimes even a quick reload doesn't work.

-- Combat -- 7/10
While comabt is fun, the weapon variety and useability of them is.. not bad, I'd say it's weak. You have your ammo weapons like shotgun or pistol, your energy weapons like energy pistol (one of the best weapons in the game) and blunt weapons which feel all the same but some are slower.
The game has a ""skill tree"" that lets you upgrade your character and glove abilities, but a lot of them seem pretty useless. Want to use your freezing from further away? Nah, here's more loot from frozen enemies.
I mentioned energy weapons before, they don't use ammo but they use your energy bar which refills itself with time, and I don't even know if it's bugger or if it is supposed to be like it, but most of the time if you have this bar upgraded, it doesn't fully refill? It just stops halfway through?

-- Enemies -- 5/10
Enemy variety isn't as bad as in some other games, but the enemies are not fun to fight with in groups, and as you will realize halfway through the game, you WILL fight with them in groups. 
But that is not the worst part, a lot of encounters are still fun.
But I can't say the same about some bosses, a lot of them are giant bullet sponges (except for the first main boss, who is super fun to fight) and they're pretty boring after some time. They close in super fast and run all around you, so if you're playing on a controller - goodluck.

-- Story -- 7/10
Not gonna say anything about it. It's not bad. I very much liked the main character and how he goes from complete butthole to Charles into.. less of a butthole.

-- Environment and Tasks Structure -- 4/10
Ehh, this one pains me. Almost every location in this game looks completely the same. Outside, inside, test grounds - all the same. But even if this is something to live through. The moundane tasks the game forces us to do are NOT fun, and the main character annoyingly calls them out about it, and that doesn't even happen one, but MULTIPLE TIMES. You'll spend a lot of time in this game looking for glass canisters, or robotic body parts, or tickets, or some other crap.

I'm not even going to bother finishing this review. Haven't played DLCs yet, but I heard the 2nd one is god awful so I'm not looking forward to that one. Good luck to anyone who's planning to 100% this, because it won't be fun (save as often as you can).",False,Strategy

The overworld map and traversal is great.  The moment to moment encounter movement and combat is great (though it could stand for an undue for silly misclicks).  But the encounter balancing is entirely out of whack.

I've just been following the early missions given by the base NPCs at the trading post.  So far I've had to reload because:

* An encounter with a Manticore in the wild
* Going to retrieve some items in a spider nest where the giant spiders were push-overs while the small spiders were end-runners as they were immune to weapons and the items given to use on them only do 1/3rd health.  They give you 6, and there's more than 2 small group of spiders.
* While chasing my rival, failing a check I didn't think was going to even be a check, falling 2 levels in a dungeon, then running into 8 skeletons 2 levels above my group of 4 adventurers.
* Following the main questline running into a mob 2+ levels over my group which could literally one shot any of them in a single round.

All of that in <8 hours on [b]normal[/b] and barely out of the tutorial area.  All with very little introduction to the underlying system or really any way to inspect ahead of time how things might go.  I thought maybe it was just me, but checking online for the encounters I had returned pages upon pages of people hitting the same brick wall with the only real consolation being Pathfinder TTRPG vets saying that the encounters are doable [b]if you have read and understand the TTRPG ruleset[/b].

It seems like the devs forgot that, as a CRPG, this might have a broader appeal than just fans of the TTRPG and would be an entry point to the system - with the requisite need to provide a little more guidance and inspection of the underlying systems.

I know there is far more game here than just the small party.  I would have loved to gotten to the kingdom management aspect of the game.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,"[h2]An amazing and unique RPG that has some flaws.[/h2]

I hesitated a while before getting this game.  Two things bothered me:  bugs that weren't fix and the unfair battles/spike in difficulty in the end.  Many people seemed to either love it or hate it.  Even with its flaws (and there are a few) I still recommend this game, and had an overall great time playing it (until the end).  Here's why:

[h3]The Good:[/h3]

The story is intersting and well done.  Companions are various (I think 12 total) and fun to mix and match.  There are a lot of ways to play your character, and I like that your character alignment can change depending on how you react to situations.  There is a lot of lore, items, and treasure in game.  It was a large, exciting world.

[h3]The Ok:[/h3]

The kingdom management gets a lot of hate, but I kind of liked it.  In my mind, it's only negative is the repetitiveness of it in the long run.  I give them credit for trying something new and interesting in rpgs, and for the most part I had fun with it.  It could get a bit stressful, and does add a lot of time to your already long playtime, so I can see how it might bore/frustrate/annoy people.

[h3]The bad:[/h3]  

Two things here, and those are the things that had me hesitate to get the game in the first place.  The first one, bugs, wasn't as bad as I feared.  I simply can't stand unfinished or buggy games; it seems to me that you are getting ripped off and the developers are too lazy to fix their own game.  At any rate, they were there, but not nearly so bad as I had feared.  The most annoying one (if it is a bug) I had was the goblin companion, although equipped with a weapon, would not attack at all.  If I unequipped the weapon, then he would try and punch, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't fix it.  That was too bad as I liked playing him, but it happened near the end so it wasn't too bad.  All other bugs were more minor irritants, than game enders.

Speaking of the game end, I come to the WORST ASPECT of this game:  the end battles.  The game can be tough early on, but after gaining a few levels I had no serious problems until the very end, the last leg you had to do before the final boss.  And wow, suddenly the devs just decided they were going to punish us for getting that far!  There were WAY TOO MANY enemies and mini-fights to get through to make it to the actual end boss.  These battles also had the SAME ANNOYING enemies that kept coming out.  I'm sorry to say, but I had to lower the difficulty 2 battles before the final boss just because I was so sick of the slog and just wanted to beat the game.  There was NO REASON for the devs to make it that annoying and difficult to go though the end.  Many others have complained about this, and yes, it is true.

[h3]Overall[/h3]

So, why do I recommend it?  It is because there is an epic game hiding in a good game, meaning that if the bugs were completely cleaned up and the end fights were such torture, this would be up there with the best rpgs of all time.  I played for almost 300 hours, and it wasn't until the very end that it became obnoxious and I could see how most people would really get to hate it.  Again though, this was the very end; most of the game was fair/challenging and very fun.

If you can deal with minor bugs and understand that in the endgame it might take a long time or you need to lower the difficulty, and that there is a kingdom management that eats up a lot of time in itself (although I think you can turn 'auto' on and not deal with it), and you feel these things won't make you go ballistic and hate the game, then you'll probably be like me and really enjoy it for what it is:  an epic dnd like game with a great adventure, story, and companions.",True,Strategy

Pros:
-Rich lore and history, good world building and introduction to the pathfinder universe
-Good story, they plant many mysteries and plot points at the very start of the game that are relevant a hundred hours later
-Extremely customizable and deep character progression
-Companions are excellent and their personal story and quests can have significant impact on the story
-Good dialogue with incredible array of choices. You can kill everyone you meet or even attempt to recruit boss enemies to your party.
-Lots of secrets, hidden loot, unique interactions and cool items

Cons:
-Awful puzzles that often involve moving back and forth between zones repeatedly with loading screens in between.
-No respec feature, no room for experimenting and can be punishing if you don't know what you're doing
-Kingdom management is awful. Unnecessarily convoluted system that has you skipping forward weeks at a time while simultaneously not giving enough time to do all research and upgrades
-The player gets so powerful later in the game that the devs seem to have difficulty creating good encounters. For example, most of the enemies near the end have a passive aura that has a chance to paralyze your characters for 60 seconds resulting in very long, unfun RNG driven fights
-Many bugs. Characters phasing through walls, becoming untargetable, some quests becoming uncompletable, npcs not ending their turns, etc",True,Strategy
Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition," This is by far the worst of the modern CRPG's I've played, which is difficult to come to terms with saying. There is clearly a lot of thought and effort put into a majority of the mechanics, but there is an inexcusable fault in the RNG that makes this game a horrible, boring or frustrating slog. I have built multiple characters and played through the tutorial quest and the follow up quest multiple times and every single time the tutorial takes me forever to complete because EVERY SINGLE ACTOR (me, my allies, my enemies) consistently roll 1-5 on their attack rolls and cannot hit anything. 

Maybe this is truly the RNG working and I just have the absolute worst luck in the world, I suppose that's possible and the person who has my exact opposite luck will have an amazing time playing this game. I sincerely doubt that's the case though. Even if it is, other significantly better CRPG's have weighted RNG systems so the game doesn't give you the same results for too long and keep you stuck in an encounter for an unfun amount of time. 

It's a shame because I love how travel works, I prefer the Pathfinder system over DnD and love the classes unique to the system. However, Baldur's Gate 3 is the game you want to play if you're looking for a digital adaptation of a TTRPG. Even if that isn't your cup of tea, the Pillars of Eternity games are also better. Solasta is better. Any other CRPG is better than this one.",False,Strategy

Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,"Oef.... close to 260hrs on record. This is some game i admit that will NOT be for all. 
At times i even wondered if it was for me, but it certainly was.

I had zero knowledge of the pathfinder setting and though i always dream of having the perfect D&D group besides me having a lot of boardgames and books it didn't happen :). 
That said... i managed this game and man it was a journey!! 
Yes i cursed and restarted many, many, many times and then some... But the internet is great at times. There were tons of instructions and help guides on how to make live easier (Character builds etc.)

I admit that i used them to it's full extent and would otherwise have NO clue what to choose mostly as it's just too many choices and terms that mean nothing to me. The 2h sword, cleave, life magic, nature magic, blink type of wording is all clear, but there's so much more. Especially in really getting the most out of your character. But i LOVED my characters and their stories... some were more fitting to me in person, but hey even that i liked.

260 hours of which i agree a LOT are me reading on what i have to do... but i'm oldschool  (and Old) and i do like reading and learning. SO it worked for me.... it's not a game you can start playing and it will work out..no no no no...
But if you invest your time in it, you get so much game and story worth. 

Im guessing the mixed part is for those people that bought this game and (like me) weren't sure what they bought and thought it an easy adventure game. Well it's not. The devs went full our nerd (or is that pathfinder :))..mode and i loved it.

Yes there's things that annoyed me... small mistakes in the worlds a word /action done wrong has impact later on that you had no clue of knowing. But well.... there's also something nice in this.. it learns us to let go and not want to control all. (i Suck at this so i did read most of the outcomes off course ;)). 

Bought the sequal right way, but there i decided i will play some short fun games in between as it's really an investment to play this. 

So if you do like your complex RPG and character build and you're not shy of learning and reading through many pages of help out there this will be a hard one for you. But if you do like it you will also manage the 260 hours and decide this was truly a GREAT game!!

But the encounter balancing is entirely out of whack.

I've just been following the early missions given by the base NPCs at the trading post.  So far I've had to reload because:

* An encounter with a Manticore in the wild
* Going to retrieve some items in a spider nest where the giant spiders were push-overs while the small spiders were end-runners as they were immune to weapons and the items given to use on them only do 1/3rd health.  They give you 6, and there's more than 2 small group of spiders.
* While chasing my rival, failing a check I didn't think was going to even be a check, falling 2 levels in a dungeon, then running into 8 skeletons 2 levels above my group of 4 adventurers.
* Following the main questline running into a mob 2+ levels over my group which could literally one shot any of them in a single round.

All of that in <8 hours on [b]normal[/b] and barely out of the tutorial area.

It seems like the devs forgot that, as a CRPG, this might have a broader appeal than just fans of the TTRPG and would be an entry point to the system - with the requisite need to provide a little more guidance and inspection of the underlying systems.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,"After 168 hours in this game, I'm at a point where the entire kingdom management part of the game is essentially a write-off. 

Yes, you can set the difficulty so that kingdom management stuff can't cause you a game over, but man, a large percentage of the hours and mental effort I put into this thing were making an honest effort to manage the kingdom. Setting it to ""screw that part, lemme just finish the plot"" after all that feels seriously insulting.

Apparently the only way to succeed at kingdom management is by studying the meta and ignoring the story that's actually happening in the game. Who knew? Not me. Here I'm reading up on Reddit, ""why are the DCs for my kingdom events so impossibly high?"" and it's because dozens of hours ago I should have been ignoring the apparently very urgent story of the game a lot more so that I could beef up my kingdom stats.

My advice to you, if you're going to invest days of your life into this game, is to either set the kingdom management on ""auto"" or read up on how to actually keep up with the kingdom events, because trying to approach it merely from what the game itself trains you to do will be inadequate, and you will waste a lot of time only to fail in the end.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,"Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the epitome of potential ruined by a single design choice.

The basic gameplay mechanics seem competent and consistent, though not revolutionary. Gather a party, gain experience, find better gear, and attempt to tackle the coming perils - the bread and butter of RPG gameplay. There are enough diverse character classes to make assembling a party roster a pleasant mental challenge, and every class has its place and a role to fill. The game’s story is coherently written, if a bit lacking in unique elements. There’s a variety of NPCs, including companions, some featuring interesting backstories, though many are fairly bland and clichéd. Kingmaker didn’t particularly make me care about any of its side characters, but exploring the companions’ backstories proved to be a pleasant break from pursuing the main storyline, while also providing some powerful and unique loot. 

The dialogue design might be the best part of the game. Certain conversation options only open up when you meet the class, stat and/or alignment requirements, lending importance to your character decisions. The world feels like it reacts to who your character is and who they surround themselves with. It is also through dialogue that you make many of the game’s important choices. This enhances Kingmaker’s replayability, as seeing the game’s events unfold differently provides a strong incentive to try out different playstyles and alignment options. Although, admittedly, some (not all) of the alignment-specific choices felt a smidge forced.

Graphical design is effective and inoffensive, while the UI is clear, elegant and easy to navigate. Impressively, the game also features a rather large encyclopedia where you can find a plethora of various in-game subjects to read about. 

So far, the game doesn’t sound so bad, right? Wherein, then, lies the main issue resulting in the aforementioned ruined potential?

The issue lies in encounter design. 

I’m not sure what the developers’ intention was. Was it to make the world feel less empty? Was it to allow the player to experience all characters’ capabilities to the fullest? I do not know. What I do know is this - the world is filled to the brim with meaningless combat encounters. There’s only so many times you can fight a basic spider, a wolf, or goblin before you have enough. And if you’re like me, you’ll have enough before clearing even a quarter of these torture devices camouflaging as battles. Most combat contributes nothing - no loot, no satisfaction, no substantial quest progression, even the XP you gain is the equivalent of a pittance. This overreliance on hostile encounters is also the reason why I never finished the game - despite investing many, many hours and starting three separate playthroughs. The ending of the game is one of the worst, most torturous ordeals that I’ve ever experienced in any video game. Pointless combat followed by pointless combat, a seemingly endless string of repetitive, uninspired encounters. This facepalm-worthy level design wore me down so much that I eventually gave up, and the only thing I regret is not giving up much sooner. 

Many people seem to dislike the kingdom management part of the game. But in my experience it was actually a welcome respite from the monotony of the incessant fighting. Don’t get me wrong - the system in question is no masterpiece, but it felt nice to strengthen your kingdom by making decisions which did not involve smashing a giant spider for the 50th time. 

Lastly, there’s the game’s accessibility factor - which is very low for those unfamiliar with Pathfinder. Prior to playing Kingmaker I’d never had prolonged contact with any tabletop RPG system, so I had to expend considerable amounts of my time and attention to learn to utilize the game’s mechanics. Accordingly, I urge you to consider the complexity of Pathfinder’s mechanics and your knowledge thereof before making your purchase.

As for me, I gave this game a more-than-fair shot. In hindsight, the Kingmaker experience wasn’t worth the effort. 

Decent mechanical core obscured by the story’s mediocrity and large shortcomings of combat encounter design. 5/10.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,"[h2]An amazing and unique RPG that has some flaws.[/h2]

I hesitated a while before getting this game.  Two things bothered me:  bugs that weren't fix and the unfair battles/spike in difficulty in the end.  Many people seemed to either love it or hate it.  Even with its flaws (and there are a few) I still recommend this game, and had an overall great time playing it (until the end).  Here's why:

[h3]The Good:[/h3]

The story is intersting and well done.  Companions are various (I think 12 total) and fun to mix and match.  There are a lot of ways to play your character, and I like that your character alignment can change depending on how you react to situations.  There is a lot of lore, items, and treasure in game.  It was a large, exciting world.

[h3]The Ok:[/h3]

The kingdom management gets a lot of hate, but I kind of liked it.  In my mind, it's only negative is the repetitiveness of it in the long run.  I give them credit for trying something new and interesting in rpgs, and for the most part I had fun with it.  It could get a bit stressful, and does add a lot of time to your already long playtime, so I can see how it might bore/frustrate/annoy people.

[h3]The bad:[/h3]  

Two things here, and those are the things that had me hesitate to get the game in the first place.  The first one, bugs, wasn't as bad as I feared.  I simply can't stand unfinished or buggy games; it seems to me that you are getting ripped off and the developers are too lazy to fix their own game.  At any rate, they were there, but not nearly so bad as I had feared.  The most annoying one (if it is a bug) I had was the goblin companion, although equipped with a weapon, would not attack at all.  If I unequipped the weapon, then he would try and punch, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't fix it.  That was too bad as I liked playing him, but it happened near the end so it wasn't too bad.  All other bugs were more minor irritants, than game enders.

Speaking of the game end, I come to the WORST ASPECT of this game:  the end battles.  The game can be tough early on, but after gaining a few levels I had no serious problems until the very end, the last leg you had to do before the final boss.  And wow, suddenly the devs just decided they were going to punish us for getting that far!  There were WAY TOO MANY enemies and mini-fights to get through to make it to the actual end boss.  These battles also had the SAME ANNOYING enemies that kept coming out.  I'm sorry to say, but I had to lower the difficulty 2 battles before the final boss just because I was so sick of the slog and just wanted to beat the game.  There was NO REASON for the devs to make it that annoying and difficult to go though the end.  Many others have complained about this, and yes, it is true.

[h3]Overall[/h3]

So, why do I recommend it?  It is because there is an epic game hiding in a good game, meaning that if the bugs were completely cleaned up and the end fights were such torture, this would be up there with the best rpgs of all time.  I played for almost 300 hours, and it wasn't until the very end that it became obnoxious and I could see how most people would really get to hate it.  Again though, this was the very end; most of the game was fair/challenging and very fun.

If you can deal with minor bugs and understand that in the endgame it might take a long time or you need to lower the difficulty, and that there is a kingdom management that eats up a lot of time in itself (although I think you can turn 'auto' on and not deal with it), and you feel these things won't make you go ballistic and hate the game, then you'll probably be like me and really enjoy it for what it is:  an epic dnd like game with a great adventure, story, and companions.",True,Strategy

Pros:
-Rich lore and history, good world building and introduction to the pathfinder universe

-Extremely customizable and deep character progression
-Companions are excellent and their personal story and quests can have significant impact on the story
-Good dialogue with incredible array of choices. You can kill everyone you meet or even attempt to recruit boss enemies to your party.
-Lots of secrets, hidden loot, unique interactions and cool items

Cons:
-Awful puzzles that often involve moving back and forth between zones repeatedly with loading screens in between.
-No respec feature, no room for experimenting and can be punishing if you don't know what you're doing
-Kingdom management is awful. Unnecessarily convoluted system that has you skipping forward weeks at a time while simultaneously not giving enough time to do all research and upgrades
-The player gets so powerful later in the game that the devs seem to have difficulty creating good encounters. For example, most of the enemies near the end have a passive aura that has a chance to paralyze your characters for 60 seconds resulting in very long, unfun RNG driven fights
-Many bugs. Characters phasing through walls, becoming untargetable, some quests becoming uncompletable, npcs not ending their turns, etc",True,Strategy
Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition," This is by far the worst of the modern CRPG's I've played, which is difficult to come to terms with saying. There is clearly a lot of thought and effort put into a majority of the mechanics, but there is an inexcusable fault in the RNG that makes this game a horrible, boring or frustrating slog. I have built multiple characters and played through the tutorial quest and the follow up quest multiple times and every single time the tutorial takes me forever to complete because EVERY SINGLE ACTOR (me, my allies, my enemies) consistently roll 1-5 on their attack rolls and cannot hit anything. 

Maybe this is truly the RNG working and I just have the absolute worst luck in the world, I suppose that's possible and the person who has my exact opposite luck will have an amazing time playing this game. I sincerely doubt that's the case though. Even if it is, other significantly better CRPG's have weighted RNG systems so the game doesn't give you the same results for too long and keep you stuck in an encounter for an unfun amount of time. 

It's a shame because I love how travel works, I prefer the Pathfinder system over DnD and love the classes unique to the system. However, Baldur's Gate 3 is the game you want to play if you're looking for a digital adaptation of a TTRPG. Even if that isn't your cup of tea, the Pillars of Eternity games are also better. Solasta is better. Any other CRPG is better than this one.",False,Strategy

Exanima,"As of 05/02/2025 the game has been in early access for OVER 10 YEARS. Steam added a feature that showed how long it was since the games developers last updated the game which as of today was 15 MONTHS AGO. Either laziness, Ineptitude or poor leadership is to blame.

[b]I WILL REPEAT, 10 YEARS IN EARLY ACCESS AND 15 MONTHS AGO SINCE LAST UPDATED.[/b]

Exanima was meant as a tech demo prerequisite to Sui Gineris, which was the original concept and was estimated for Exanima to be in EA for approximately 9 months. Promises made but not delivered. They do have a monthly ""coffee talk"" which is meant to overview progress but is filled with things they ""feel"" is necessary rather than getting on with updating what is currently available. Massive engine updates to add inconsequential things. More so even it seems they brag about improving cloth physics, terrain changes, or even texture changes that are slightly shinier, that which grass and light can penetrate through, than the ones before. In which took them several months to make but still needs improvement. 

As of right now the monotonous game play cycle has worn thin. Only a few enemies feel like the AI is past the point of worth fighting against as the vast majority simply spam attacks onto the player, let alone the giants which just rush onto the player character model which breaks the combat as swinging weapons is dependant on the room of which it is allowed to be swung. The ""intuitive"" controls are not difficult as many have stated and are just clunky in the grand scheme of things. Bring the cursor onto one side of the enemy, click and drag over and passed them to hit them. Rinse and Repeat. Also being hit staggers the player which prevents retaliation so you can be essentially stun locked to death.

Also having only a few checkpoints which is an auto save does not mean it is adding a reason to play less aggressive and more ""strategic"". It only exist it seems to aggravate the player, and comes across as to pad game play time. Simply adding save rooms through various parts of the game would alleviate frustration to newer players which is regularly discussed. Then again there is only a few levels so it often feels fruitless to continue once you get passed them all.

TL:DR: Not recommended, developers waste time refining the engine with inconsequential things rather than improving core and essential needs of the game such as actual game play improvements and story. People judge on what can be played now, not what is promised in the future and not delivered. [b]10 YEARS IN EARLY ACCESS AND 15 MONTHS AGO SINCE LAST UPDATED. 05/02/2025[/b]",False,Strategy
Exanima,"An unfinished symphony? So much potential but the devs don't seem to be interested in finishing it. 

I adore this game. The difficulty. The raw challenge of navigation. The innovative combat system.
Yes it's clunky. It's a physics based combat system. With practice though, you will learn to land the perfect shot and its SO SATISFYING when your halberd crashes into their face. It really has such a satisfying combat system that i've spent 100 hours probably in just the arena mode. If only it was multiplayer?

Outside of the combat, it's an unforgiving, unfinished dungeon crawler. It wouldn't take that much effort to finish it, but the devs just... don't. WHY? diving down some rabbit hole about cloth textures and 'ai roles'. Nobody cares. Just finish it and move on.",True,Strategy
Exanima,"Exanima is a very fun dungeon crawler with better atmosphere and story pacing than most games released in the same time frame.  The combat is challenging and punishing but ultimately very rewarding once you learn your kung-fu.  The skill system is consequential and each new skill (with some exception in the magic trees) gives your character a new combat ability rather than just changing the damage or speed of an attack by X%.  Leveling up feels very consequential. The game runs great and crashes are extremely rare.  The level design is fantastic and is the largest driver of the diegetic narrative of Exanima.  Really the only negative I have with the game is the recent trend of the level design rely on precise platforming in a roguelike game where regularly walking down a hallway without tripping is considered an achievement.

Perhaps my favorite part of Exanima is the equipment system.  There are SO MANY LAYERS.  There is clothing, then mail, then jackets, then armor for nearly every body part.  There is a coverage system that also determines what gear is occupying what slot and in which layers which is so intuitive that there is no need for a cluttered UI explaining all the details.

If the story mode wasn't enough, there is also an endless Arena mode where you compose a team of NPC and PC fighters that can compete in various scenarios like different arrangements of team-fights, monster fights, free for all, weapon trials, duels, etc.  You earn money which can be used to purchase support characters like doctors or trainers, equipment, and new fighters.  It is extremely fun, and I hope it gets fleshed out more in updates to come.

So... updates.  Many recent reviews seem targeted at the length of time Exanima has been in development and the length of time between updates as a negative.  I think this is unfair.  The updates are usually MASSIVE changes in how the game is played.  They usually include extremely large new areas to explore in story Mode, changes to the combat system, adding new systems, and even a lil ol morsel for us Arena enjoyers.  My point is this: the developers have been very clear on what this product is and what their plans are for it.  They have provided updates which make good on the planned features they have previously communicated.  They also provide monthly reports on progress and direction.   In my opinion, the length of time between updates reflects the quality of content contained within.

So I think it should really tell you something about what kind of product you're getting when the recent negative reviews are so hungry for more content that they are willing to dumpster a $15 game they've spent 50+ hours in.  Let me be clear, even if they never update this game again and stop all communication, the $15 you spend on this game will not be wasted.

I don't care what's going on behind the scenes, there is NO WAY it's that hard to add a new enemy, weapon or level section semi-regularly. 

That said, it's also unacceptable to say the game is a rip-off or not worth your time or money. It's 15 dollars. The price of a medium sized meal at wendy's. 15 dollars for an extremely interesting and fun ragdoll-based combat system in a dark gritty dungeon with a sizeable amount of levels and enemies to get through, as well as a really solid arena fighting minigame.

Exanima,"""1 Step forward 5 steps back"" - the game. Or ""Development Hell Simulator"".

I was really hyped 10 years ago, when the ea version released. I played very little, not to spoil anything for the full release. A couple of years later around 18/19 I picked it up again and I really enjoyed the mechanics, the ""content"" that was available and started to regularly read their ""coffee diary"". 

It became quite evident that they are not in a rush at all. This felt good, because I wanted them to deliver quality. But as time went on, updates stalled and their ""progress"" was evidently non existing. Their journal became more and more ridiculous and disappointing. Instead of adding up to what they already had, they took more and more steps backwards to overhaul fundamentals. No new content in sight, but weapon-generation had become procedural. Hurray... Then they made new shaders. New movements. And so on. Nothing that had impact. Their diary became more and more technical in way that bored the community until players left in disappointment. In their latest ""update"" they showed pics of shadows that look a little bit different than before...

Putting down the pink glasses reading their journal feels like ""we planned to do a certain thing, but now got bothered with something completely unrelated that will sidetrack and distract us for 2 years. So no updates until then. And when an update comes, you won't even notice, except for a save-wipe"". 
Or ""we weren't satisfied with how a certain piece of cloth moved during our secret testing, so we have to rewrite the whole engine"". In 10 years from now, they will try to reinvent zeros and ones, because they're unhappy with the state of the binary system. And when they're done they have to start their work all over again on their project because it's outdated severely.

Last version I actively played was 0.7.something. Six years later now in 25 they are at 0.9.something. I had a gander back at their page, but nothing has changed significantly, except for how they do their diary. It's less entries now...wow.

Either they got completely lost in technicalites and forgot they were making a game; they have lost interest and won't admit it; they have no idea in what direction to go with their ""game""; suffer from mental health issues -> pathologically stuck in a non-existent overhaul process or a combination of those points. 

The actual state feels like a demo with a nice idea behind it, but the controls and camera are so difficult, time consuming to learn and handle, that many players give up after a short time. To those who manage to actually git gud, it does feel really rewarding, but this gets played down because there is almost no content. What's actually there in terms of story elements is so scarce and only bits and pieces that just tell you about its potential. But potential that is left untouched is the same as nothing. 

That doesn't mean that people cannot enjoy what's there. Again: their movement and fighting system takes a lot to even get used to. The exploration through their levels is also quite nice. But there is so saving, so if you die after a certain level, ALL your progress up to this point is lost and you have to (almost) start all over again. 

If you like learning difficult controls and experimenting with different weapons, enemies, etc... it can be fun for a time. It was for me. But it's just really disappointing when you slowly discover that all your effort doesn't lead anywhere.

What they call a game is a tech demo at best, which is stuck in development hell for well over 10 years. And I'm not even talking about Sui Genris which at this point is a complete dilusion. Even Steam wrote a public warning on their store page that their last update is over 15 months old.

When I purchase a game, especially on EA, I always try to purchase it on the merits it HAS not the promise of merits it WILL have. I don't buy a game because there WILL be content, I buy a game because there IS. I bought this game because I wanted an easy to learn, hard to master dungeon crawler with a unique twist and it has delivered that to me and more! For a $15 price point, I'm more than happy with the product I bought and deeply enjoy what they have down here currently. It makes me excited for whatever their next updates will bring and eventually what Sui Generis will be.

Everyone's chief complaints about this game are well founded. There are some bits and bobs here and there with gameplay that are not very intuitive, some enemies are just downright obnoxious to fight, and sometimes the physics just kinda... freaks out. That last bit could be seen as a positive depending on who you are lol

The biggest elephant in the room though is the dev cycle. Its slow, like slower than any dev cycle for a game I've ever seen. Its hard to tell people to ""just be patient"" or ""you knew what you were paying for with EA"" when you have people waiting upwards of over a year for updates to be pushed out. However, I do believe in their vision for the game. Every coffee diary they release gives us a greater insight (albeit one that at times seems a bit... unfocused) to what they're wanting for this expansive project and it genuinely feels like I'm watching one of the most innovative, charming dungeon crawlers I've ever played be developed in slow motion lol.

Do I think you should play this game? Yes. A thousand times yes. for $15? More than a fair deal for what you get now. Its fun, its innovative, and its a good game to lose a couple dozen hours to.

Do I think I'll see the next update before I'm 80? Gosh I hope so lol.

""Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
Around six to nine months, give or take three months! Honestly, we can't provide an exact timeframe as there are many factors involved, some of which are beyond our control. These include feedback from a wider community and, ultimately, Exanima's success which will determine our budget going forward.""

Exanima,"Ten years. That’s how long we’ve waited for this game to fulfil its ambitious promises. But after a decade of ""development,"" it's painfully clear that Bare Mettle is more interested in endlessly tinkering with their precious game engine than actually delivering the experience we were promised.

What about the core gameplay? It’s still stuck in the same frustrating cycle of clunky controls and rudimentary content. Combat may be physics-driven, but that ""innovation"" comes at the cost of basic responsiveness. Every action feels like controlling a marionette through molasses. The NPC AI? They’re supposedly ""smarter"" and more ""immersive,"" according to the wordy monthly dev posts, but mostly they just bumble around and spout stilted, repetitive dialogue.

And don't get me started on the role system. It's been talked about in blog post after blog post, filled with endless jargon about dynamic behaviors and emergent complexity, yet the actual implementation is nothing more than vague, placeholder features. NPCs ""might"" do something, depending on a thousand invisible variables you can’t influence or even track. At best, the system feels half-baked; at worst, it’s incoherent.

Meanwhile, Bare Mettle brags about how they spent months optimizing their cloth physics or refining a new terrain system (wow new tile textures!!!). Sure, it's impressive they can simulate cloth with ""millions of polygons"" or overhaul how grass or cracks in tiles interact with lighting, but none of that matters when your players are still waiting to experience the actual game.

The bottom line is this: No one buys a game to marvel at the backend of its engine. They buy games for compelling gameplay, engaging stories, and functional mechanics—none of which Bare Mettle has managed to deliver in ten years. At this point, the game is nothing more than a tech demo wrapped in empty promises.

Unless the developers can break their obsessive cycle of endless technical refinement and focus on finishing a product worth playing, this game will go down as one of the most tragic examples of wasted potential in modern indie development.",False,Strategy

Exanima,"As of 05/02/2025 the game has been in early access for OVER 10 YEARS. Steam added a feature that showed how long it was since the games developers last updated the game which as of today was 15 MONTHS AGO. Either laziness, Ineptitude or poor leadership is to blame.

[b]I WILL REPEAT, 10 YEARS IN EARLY ACCESS AND 15 MONTHS AGO SINCE LAST UPDATED.[/b]

Exanima was meant as a tech demo prerequisite to Sui Gineris, which was the original concept and was estimated for Exanima to be in EA for approximately 9 months. Promises made but not delivered. They do have a monthly ""coffee talk"" which is meant to overview progress but is filled with things they ""feel"" is necessary rather than getting on with updating what is currently available. Massive engine updates to add inconsequential things. More so even it seems they brag about improving cloth physics, terrain changes, or even texture changes that are slightly shinier, that which grass and light can penetrate through, than the ones before. In which took them several months to make but still needs improvement. 

As of right now the monotonous game play cycle has worn thin. Only a few enemies feel like the AI is past the point of worth fighting against as the vast majority simply spam attacks onto the player, let alone the giants which just rush onto the player character model which breaks the combat as swinging weapons is dependant on the room of which it is allowed to be swung. The ""intuitive"" controls are not difficult as many have stated and are just clunky in the grand scheme of things. Bring the cursor onto one side of the enemy, click and drag over and passed them to hit them. Rinse and Repeat. Also being hit staggers the player which prevents retaliation so you can be essentially stun locked to death.

Also having only a few checkpoints which is an auto save does not mean it is adding a reason to play less aggressive and more ""strategic"". It only exist it seems to aggravate the player, and comes across as to pad game play time. Simply adding save rooms through various parts of the game would alleviate frustration to newer players which is regularly discussed. Then again there is only a few levels so it often feels fruitless to continue once you get passed them all.

TL:DR: Not recommended, developers waste time refining the engine with inconsequential things rather than improving core and essential needs of the game such as actual game play improvements and story. People judge on what can be played now, not what is promised in the future and not delivered. [b]10 YEARS IN EARLY ACCESS AND 15 MONTHS AGO SINCE LAST UPDATED. 05/02/2025[/b]",False,Strategy

I adore this game. The difficulty. The raw challenge of navigation. The innovative combat system.
Yes it's clunky. It's a physics based combat system. With practice though, you will learn to land the perfect shot and its SO SATISFYING when your halberd crashes into their face. It really has such a satisfying combat system that i've spent 100 hours probably in just the arena mode. If only it was multiplayer?

Outside of the combat, it's an unforgiving, unfinished dungeon crawler. It wouldn't take that much effort to finish it, but the devs just... don't. WHY? diving down some rabbit hole about cloth textures and 'ai roles'. Nobody cares. Just finish it and move on.",True,Strategy

Just watch a video of the combat and see how wonky and strange every animation is.

Yes it sucks that there hasn't been a major update in over a year but review bombing isn't going to make an update magically appear out of Madoc's ass.",True,Strategy
Exanima,"Exanima is a very fun dungeon crawler with better atmosphere and story pacing than most games released in the same time frame.  The combat is challenging and punishing but ultimately very rewarding once you learn your kung-fu.  The skill system is consequential and each new skill (with some exception in the magic trees) gives your character a new combat ability rather than just changing the damage or speed of an attack by X%.  Leveling up feels very consequential. The game runs great and crashes are extremely rare.  The level design is fantastic and is the largest driver of the diegetic narrative of Exanima.  Really the only negative I have with the game is the recent trend of the level design rely on precise platforming in a roguelike game where regularly walking down a hallway without tripping is considered an achievement.

Perhaps my favorite part of Exanima is the equipment system.  There are SO MANY LAYERS.  There is clothing, then mail, then jackets, then armor for nearly every body part.  There is a coverage system that also determines what gear is occupying what slot and in which layers which is so intuitive that there is no need for a cluttered UI explaining all the details.

If the story mode wasn't enough, there is also an endless Arena mode where you compose a team of NPC and PC fighters that can compete in various scenarios like different arrangements of team-fights, monster fights, free for all, weapon trials, duels, etc.  You earn money which can be used to purchase support characters like doctors or trainers, equipment, and new fighters.  It is extremely fun, and I hope it gets fleshed out more in updates to come.

So... updates.  Many recent reviews seem targeted at the length of time Exanima has been in development and the length of time between updates as a negative.  I think this is unfair.  The updates are usually MASSIVE changes in how the game is played.  They usually include extremely large new areas to explore in story Mode, changes to the combat system, adding new systems, and even a lil ol morsel for us Arena enjoyers.  My point is this: the developers have been very clear on what this product is and what their plans are for it.  They have provided updates which make good on the planned features they have previously communicated.  They also provide monthly reports on progress and direction.   In my opinion, the length of time between updates reflects the quality of content contained within.

So I think it should really tell you something about what kind of product you're getting when the recent negative reviews are so hungry for more content that they are willing to dumpster a $15 game they've spent 50+ hours in.  Let me be clear, even if they never update this game again and stop all communication, the $15 you spend on this game will not be wasted.  There is more content and fun currently in the game than I've seen in games I've spent more than double that on.",True,Strategy
Exanima,"I think the game the was interesting but the controlling of the character was/is jarring. I understand its suppose to be like that, but it just feels more like your controlling a drunk guy.

I don't care what's going on behind the scenes, there is NO WAY it's that hard to add a new enemy, weapon or level section semi-regularly. 

That said, it's also unacceptable to say the game is a rip-off or not worth your time or money. It's 15 dollars. The price of a medium sized meal at wendy's. 15 dollars for an extremely interesting and fun ragdoll-based combat system in a dark gritty dungeon with a sizeable amount of levels and enemies to get through, as well as a really solid arena fighting minigame.

Exanima,"""1 Step forward 5 steps back"" - the game. Or ""Development Hell Simulator"".

I was really hyped 10 years ago, when the ea version released. I played very little, not to spoil anything for the full release. A couple of years later around 18/19 I picked it up again and I really enjoyed the mechanics, the ""content"" that was available and started to regularly read their ""coffee diary"". 

It became quite evident that they are not in a rush at all. This felt good, because I wanted them to deliver quality. But as time went on, updates stalled and their ""progress"" was evidently non existing. Their journal became more and more ridiculous and disappointing. Instead of adding up to what they already had, they took more and more steps backwards to overhaul fundamentals. No new content in sight, but weapon-generation had become procedural. Hurray... Then they made new shaders. New movements. And so on. Nothing that had impact. Their diary became more and more technical in way that bored the community until players left in disappointment. In their latest ""update"" they showed pics of shadows that look a little bit different than before...

Putting down the pink glasses reading their journal feels like ""we planned to do a certain thing, but now got bothered with something completely unrelated that will sidetrack and distract us for 2 years. So no updates until then. And when an update comes, you won't even notice, except for a save-wipe"". 
Or ""we weren't satisfied with how a certain piece of cloth moved during our secret testing, so we have to rewrite the whole engine"". In 10 years from now, they will try to reinvent zeros and ones, because they're unhappy with the state of the binary system. And when they're done they have to start their work all over again on their project because it's outdated severely.

Last version I actively played was 0.7.something. Six years later now in 25 they are at 0.9.something. I had a gander back at their page, but nothing has changed significantly, except for how they do their diary. It's less entries now...wow.

Either they got completely lost in technicalites and forgot they were making a game; they have lost interest and won't admit it; they have no idea in what direction to go with their ""game""; suffer from mental health issues -> pathologically stuck in a non-existent overhaul process or a combination of those points. 

The actual state feels like a demo with a nice idea behind it, but the controls and camera are so difficult, time consuming to learn and handle, that many players give up after a short time. To those who manage to actually git gud, it does feel really rewarding, but this gets played down because there is almost no content. What's actually there in terms of story elements is so scarce and only bits and pieces that just tell you about its potential. But potential that is left untouched is the same as nothing. 

That doesn't mean that people cannot enjoy what's there. Again: their movement and fighting system takes a lot to even get used to. The exploration through their levels is also quite nice. But there is so saving, so if you die after a certain level, ALL your progress up to this point is lost and you have to (almost) start all over again. 

If you like learning difficult controls and experimenting with different weapons, enemies, etc... it can be fun for a time. It was for me. But it's just really disappointing when you slowly discover that all your effort doesn't lead anywhere.

What they call a game is a tech demo at best, which is stuck in development hell for well over 10 years. And I'm not even talking about Sui Genris which at this point is a complete dilusion. Even Steam wrote a public warning on their store page that their last update is over 15 months old.

Exanima,"I absolutely love what Bare Mettle is crafting here. Ive followed Exanima from the beginning and you can really feel the love theyve put into their game and its world. The physics theyve built into the engine allows for some incredibly satisfying and rewarding combat/gameplay (thaumaturgy is way too much fun already, I cant wait to see where the dev team goes with it).

The dev team may be small (hence the wait between updates) but theyre very communicative about what theyre working on every month and incredibly passionate about their project. Its been well worth the money.",True,Strategy

Exanima,"it is nearly impossible to find health replenish items. this is quite literal without exaggeration. the game's mechanics are fun and the main adventure intriguing, but your fun will stop once you realize that your health will never replenish, forcing you to start all over again. no, i don't recommend if you dont like to lose all your progress and restart from scratch getting random loot entirely. keep note, health items appearing are like 0% In loot boxes.",False,Strategy
Exanima,"Very great game! It does a great job at physics, terrain and its own mechanics. Played about through the whole game and i'm now very intrigued at what new updates this game will have in store. Yeah, i may have gotten lost a bunch of times, but in return i got good loot! 

Good:
- very immersive
- pretty much the first game to have physics as a major mechanic (i think)
- MA BEST FREND, DERRIL!!! (yes, i know its ""derryn"" i just prefer to call him derril)
- I LOVE THE THAUMATURGY!!!!! (especially force)

Bad:
-WHERE DA HELL AM I??? I CANT GO TWO STEPS WITHOUT BEING LOST AGAIN, AND THE MAPS FOR THE LATER LEVELS ARE JUST SCRIBBLES? ESPECIALLY LEVEL 8, BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS A DARK PIT
-can be frustrating at times
-nothing else, really.

this game is fantastic...    for me, just because i like it doesn't mean you will, if you love physics and get the hang of it, have good memory, love medieval stuff. then this is a good buy. By the way, be prepared to die...

Exanima,"[h1]Exanima feels like a prelude to a much greater design that we may or may not see, and frankly I'm okay with that.[/h1]

When I purchase a game, especially on EA, I always try to purchase it on the merits it HAS not the promise of merits it WILL have. I don't buy a game because there WILL be content, I buy a game because there IS. I bought this game because I wanted an easy to learn, hard to master dungeon crawler with a unique twist and it has delivered that to me and more! For a $15 price point, I'm more than happy with the product I bought and deeply enjoy what they have down here currently. It makes me excited for whatever their next updates will bring and eventually what Sui Generis will be.

Everyone's chief complaints about this game are well founded. There are some bits and bobs here and there with gameplay that are not very intuitive, some enemies are just downright obnoxious to fight, and sometimes the physics just kinda... freaks out. That last bit could be seen as a positive depending on who you are lol

The biggest elephant in the room though is the dev cycle. Its slow, like slower than any dev cycle for a game I've ever seen. Its hard to tell people to ""just be patient"" or ""you knew what you were paying for with EA"" when you have people waiting upwards of over a year for updates to be pushed out. However, I do believe in their vision for the game. Every coffee diary they release gives us a greater insight (albeit one that at times seems a bit... unfocused) to what they're wanting for this expansive project and it genuinely feels like I'm watching one of the most innovative, charming dungeon crawlers I've ever played be developed in slow motion lol.

Do I think you should play this game? Yes. A thousand times yes. for $15? More than a fair deal for what you get now. Its fun, its innovative, and its a good game to lose a couple dozen hours to.

Do I think I'll see the next update before I'm 80? Gosh I hope so lol.

Amazing game with long dev cycles and some minor nitpicks. I fully recommend playing it but be aware you'll be waiting a while for updates. Game isn't dead, just in a quiet type of development hell.",True,Strategy
Exanima,"Quote from steam page of this game's description that was released into early access on 29th of April 2015:

""Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
Around six to nine months, give or take three months! Honestly, we can't provide an exact timeframe as there are many factors involved, some of which are beyond our control. These include feedback from a wider community and, ultimately, Exanima's success which will determine our budget going forward.""

It's 4th of February 2025 today, 3 months untill full 10 years have passed.

1 April 2020 Exanima 0.8 Released
19 December 2021 Exanima 0.8.3
17 July 2022 Exanima 0.8.4
13 October 2023 Exanima 0.9

Despite being a solo experience, the game offers intense and action-packed combat that keeps players engaged. There are no strict rules on how you engage in combat. Whether you prefer sniping from a distance, going in guns blazing, or piloting helicopters and tanks, Ravenfield lets you play however you like. The low-poly graphics may seem simple, but they add to the game’s charm while keeping performance smooth even in large-scale battles. Explosions, ragdoll physics, and chaotic firefights make every battle feel cinematic and fun. Ravenfield is a fantastic choice for FPS fans who enjoy large-scale battles without the need for multiplayer. It’s fun, highly customizable, and offers endless replayability through mods.

This game has two forms 
A. Base game, a solid game, nothing too crazy but the concept to which you can work and play. Paired with a decent physics engine and okay graphics.

B. Modded. Holy Jesus christ, Mother Theresa all mighty. That AT-ST just blew up an abrams and an f16 just annihilated a tie fighter. The graphics on this thing are crazy, near infinite maps and weapons and skins. 

It should be noted that all of these mods are on the steam workshop, being vetted and safe to use, with a huge community and many dedicated creators who keep expanding the portfolio of what you can with dedicated groups for different goals. 

From moderate mods such as the Vanilla+ series and Camera and physics mods. 
To Star wars overhauls and massive projects like WW2 and the Leersog.

the bots are admittedly pretty stupid, so IMO you should come into this game for the gunplay.  the TTK varies between weapons but hovers around ≈1 second if you're accurate enough.  there is bullet travel time and bullet drop, meaning mid- to long-range combat isn't just pointing and shooting, and so sniping can be quite challenging

vanilla is definitely fun enough, but modding will likely exponentiate the overall time you will spend with this game.  there's so much on there for every type of player that it's honestly kinda hard to sift through",True,Strategy

Battlefield™ 2042,"So this is what happens when you design a Battlefield game without actually playing one! Despite all the updates, Battlefield 2042 remains a hollow experience. Empty maps, unbalanced operatives, no single-player, and a wasted ""Portal"" mode make this feel like the most disappointing Battlefield entry in years.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Breakdown:
🔹 Story Quality: N/A – No single-player campaign.

🔹 Story Depth: N/A – Again, there’s no campaign, so there’s nothing to rate here.

🎮 Controls: The core gunplay and movement are decent, but nothing groundbreaking.

🌍 Immersiveness: Maps feel empty, lacking the chaos and dynamic combat that defined classic Battlefield games.

⚔️ Difficulty: The biggest challenge isn’t the enemies—it’s dealing with poor balancing and questionable design choices.

🗺 Level Design: Huge but lifeless maps that feel designed for a different game entirely.

🎨 Graphics: Visually, it looks good, but great graphics can’t save bad design.

🎵 Sound & Soundtrack: Serviceable, but lacks the impact of earlier Battlefield titles.

🕹 Gameplay: When it works, it’s fine, but poor balance and lackluster content make it a struggle to enjoy.

🐛 Bugs: Many fixes have improved stability, but early impressions still haunt the game.

⌛ Playtime: Depends on tolerance for frustration.

🔁 Replayability: Once you see the game’s flaws, there’s little reason to stick around.

💰 Price-to-Quality: Not worth full price, and even on sale, it’s a tough sell.

The Good:
✅ Decent gunplay and movement.

✅ Graphics are solid.

✅ Some fun moments—if you can find the right match.

The Bad:
❌ Empty, poorly designed maps.

❌ Zero single-player campaign.

❌ Completely unbalanced operatives (enjoy fighting Falks all day).

❌ ""Portal"" mode was abandoned.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
Battlefield 2042 was supposed to be a return to form, but even after updates, it remains a disappointing, empty experience. If you love Battlefield, you’re better off revisiting BF4, BF1, or BFV. This one just isn’t worth your time.

✔️ Huge, chaotic battles
✔️ COD like movement
✔️ Maps are much better now
✔️ Getting updates every week

❌ Too Much AI bots 
❌ Cringe Dialogue
❌ Cringe Character Models
❌ Less People on Portal Mode

Battlefield™ 2042,"I've played enough of this 2042 to realize I barely have any hope left for future Battlefield games. I had pre-ordered into the beta and returned my purchase after the first match. When this came out it took them 3 months just to add a scoreboard. a ""legacy feature"" that they felt didn't need to be in an FPS title. They added specialist with the most cringe voice lines to sell goofy Ah skins, deviating from the squad play that battlefield is classical known for. They added A.I. to fill their empty servers. They launched with 7 maps, all which had to be reworked because of lack of cover. At best this was a terrible arcade COD clone. While the state of the game now is stable, its game-play is shallow and the servers dwindle.

While I can recommend it ON SALES - do not spend 40 bucks on it - because it can give you some strong battlefield moments and it still played around the world, buy 2042 with caution:

- Matchmaking only is not great, you can't choose servers and so... they had to implement a netcode that is one of the worse in the BF franchise: server interpolation is so strong that it can kill you when you just saved your ass and are behind a wall since 1 actual second.
- Game is blurry as fck and a bit ugly, especialy when compared to BF5. It feel like a total downgrade. You also can't disable TAA that mainly cause the blurryness, so you must live with it.
- Specializations are really weird, you can play engineers with snipers, medics with LMG... making IMHO Assault/Sniper classes pretty much useless for team purposes.
- Operators are just skins and are really off in a war game, it's like Call of Duty.

That's too bad because the settings is good, it had strong potential, but know I can understand why this game is hated so much. BF Studios must have a good look in here to not reproduce this a 2nd time in a row. Anyway, for 8 bucks it's fun - not 50.",True,Strategy

Battlefield 2042 had the potential to be a groundbreaking entry in the franchise, but it stumbled at launch with missing features, balancing issues, and technical problems.

The massive maps and 128-player battles sound exciting on paper but often feel too empty or chaotic. The specialists system replaced the beloved class system, leading to a loss of teamplay depth. However, gunplay and movement feel solid, and updates have introduced much-needed improvements.

Battlefield™ 2042,"Battlefield 2042: A Rocky Redemption Arc with Glimmers of Brilliance​

DICE’s Battlefield 2042 launched in 2021 as a cautionary tale of ambition outpacing execution. Two years post-release, the game has evolved into a functional—if uneven—live-service shooter that occasionally channels the franchise’s legendary chaos. Set in a near-future climate apocalypse, its sandbox thrives on environmental spectacle: tornadoes shredding skyscrapers, sandstorms swallowing tanks, and 128-player battles that teeter between exhilarating and overwhelming.

The gunplay, after extensive rebalancing, now feels crisp and responsive, with weapons like the SFAR-GL and NTW-50 offering distinct tactical flavors. The reworked class system partially salvages the maligned ""Specialist"" mechanic, though hero-shooter elements still clash with Battlefield’s traditional team-play identity. Maps like Renewal and Spearhead benefit from layout overhauls, but vast empty spaces and inconsistent cover remain pain points.

Portal Mode stands as the game’s unsung hero, allowing community-driven remixes of classic Battlefield moments—think BC2’s Rush on 1942 maps—though its potential is hamstrung by limited official support. Cross-play and improved performance on current-gen consoles are wins, yet persistent bugs (flying vehicles, disappearing HUDs) and a thin post-launch content pipeline leave veterans craving more.

Visually, it’s a technical marvel when the chaos crescendos, but bland textures and robotic animations betray its rushed development. The score, however, masterfully blends electronic dread with orchestral urgency.

Verdict: 7/10. Battlefield 2042 is a phoenix still mid-rebirth. It delivers fleeting moments of franchise magic for patient fans but struggles to fully atone for its sins. Approach as a $40 “work in progress” rather than a premium military sim.",True,Strategy

Battlefield™ 2042,"Is the game fun? sure. is it worth your money, not a chance. 
Total lack of a single player campaign/story mode means unless you want to play multiplayer you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere. In addition the multiplayer has gotten to the point where class customization is kind of pointless. 
Lots QOL issues across classes although kinda glaring is in the scout class you cannot zero your rifle, even if it were setting the zero before the match and not changing it mid match it would be better than not setting it at all. I personally want to know what my zero is before I take my first shot as a scout. The maps are decent but they lack a certain ge ne say quois, with BF4 you had the levolution mechanic, with BF1 you had the massive war machines, BF 2042 doesn't really have any of that.

The amount of micro transactions is frankly attrocious, I miss the time when a game was released for X dollars and that was it, you got the entire game. there was no pay to win, pay to look pretty etc.

Battlefield™ 2042,"Unfinished, soulless shell of what the franchise used to be still riddled with technical problems. 

Gameplay
Unbalanced mess with poorly designed maps and a lack of meaningful squad play. The removal of the traditional class system in favor of ""Specialists"" strips away the teamwork-focused gameplay. Instead of distinct roles that encourage cooperation, everyone just feels like running around with gadgets that don’t add any real depth.

Maps 
The maps in 2042 are some of the worst in the series. They’re way too large and feel like they were designed for a battle royale game rather than a traditional experience. The design encourages long, dull treks across empty landscapes only to be sniped or mowed down by vehicles before you even reach the fight. They tried to combat it with game modes that reduce your area of the map but again maps are not designed for that so it makes even bigger mess. 

Matchmaking 
If the gameplay and maps weren’t bad enough, the matchmaking system somehow makes everything worse. Lobbies are constantly unbalanced, with one team steamrolling the other while the match drags on painfully. Solo players are thrown into matches with barely any consideration for skill level, leading to incredibly one-sided games.

Battlefield™ 2042,This game is a joke. I played on console first before switching to PC. Ran okay on console but the core game was just meh. Moved to PC and got one session out of the game. Next session I accidentally join matchmaking for a mode I don't want to play and cancel matchmaking. The game instantly crashed and has been unlaunchable since. This game is pure rubbish and a waste of money. Even free to play wouldn't make this mess worth touching.,False,Strategy
Battlefield™ 2042,Of course when this game was released it was a disaster. But what a remarkable turn around they have made. Went back and played this game to see and it is a lot of fun now. Problem is winning back the player base at this point is difficult. Game has come along way.,True,Strategy

Battlefield™ 2042,"As someone who has played battlefield starting with 1942 road to Rome this was the biggest disappointment since BF3. Although I have to admit I am not able to give up on the franchise just yet.

There were times when I really enjoyed myself in this one, However most of the time that wasn’t the case. Cant recommend 2042 but hope that the new title is the saving grace.",False,Strategy
Battlefield™ 2042,"I can't start a game no matter how long the game is really bad

The problem appeared to me from 5 days so far, I can never be able to enter any server, whether it is 64 or 128, without waiting for about 20 minutes, and in the end, I am the only player who waits and fails in the end 
Really PUBG Mobile game better than BF2042",False,Strategy
Battlefield™ 2042,"It's a great game.
Really, great.

BUT, you're going to be disappointed.

The game has so many great features, as well as so many lessons learned from the previous titles.
But it suffers from the same problems as previous titles as well:

 - The big one: Lack of servers in some countries.
Meaning that you're on the border of getting kicked off servers for bad ping if you play on the existing ones.
There also seems to be no indication that it may change any time soon. I'm lucky in that my country has one privately-hosted server running for a few hours a day. But if you're outside of the EU or USA, you're going to be fighting to stay ""unkicked"" for ping. This, in turn, leads to the next issue:

 - ""Dead"" game modes. (Which will leave you unable to get some of the steam achievements...)
 As mentioned above, servers are an issue, which means a loss of players. A loss of players means the few remaining players have to stick together in common game modes if they want to play.  
There really are modes that are dead 24/7. I'm not sure if it's the matchmaking locking us to a region or if there really are no players for said game modes internationally.

 -  Crashes and Bug are still and issue. I haven't seem any game-breaking ones personally, but I have had instances where I called it a day after a crash midway into a great match with friends.


I had fun.
However, after 50 hours of playing against bots and conquest matches for an hour a day, i feel I paid way too much for what I got. Perhaps the market for the game simply isn't that good outside of the EU and the USA.
The bit that I played was great fun and feature-rich, and I hope to change my review when the Battlefield franchise opens up to the rest of the world.",False,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Phasmophobia is a truly unique game, unlike anything I've played before. Unfortunately, the community can be rough on newbies; I've been kicked from more lobbies than I can count just because I'm not high-level yet. But, if you score a good group or have friends to team up with, it's an experience you've got to try.

Now, I'm not one for completing all tasks or nailing that perfect investigation; I'm simply here for the fun of figuring out the ghost type whilst being hunted. Sadly, the majority of players seem to be after achievements etc. and therefore the key is to find players who vibe with your style, or you might find yourself booted out more often than not.

The community aside, however, this is a great game that's still going strong after so many years—a testament to its niche offering in a typically over-saturated gaming market.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Fun both with and without friends, but certainly funnier with friends. Endless trolling potential, especially with cursed possesions. Might take some time to get into it as there is a lot of information you have to infer on your own from playing or through wiki-gaming. The devs deliver on their promises of updates and that's what makes this game so good imo as you have reasons to get back into it.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"This game is truly scary. this is a ghost hunting game and goal of this game is to go into a house or building and try and figure out what type of ghost is occupying the building. You are able to do this by finding various evidence by using equipment and gadgets. You are also able to complete side objectives that give you extra money and experience. 

When I play this game solo, I almost lose my balls when I get jumpscared and killed by the ghost. Playing in groups makes the game feel less scary, but it can still be scary. The game gets even scarier when you play on nightmare and insanity which are the 2 hardest difficulties. 

Outside of that, there are many different ghost types with some being more dangerous than others, and at the end of the day, this is a well made horror game with fun and exciting gameplay.",True,Strategy

Proud to see how far it’s come!",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Honestly this game is fun but it seriously needs more jumpscares. Its been out for 5 years now with the exact same scare for every ghost there is no excuse that it should have taken this long. The game is so stale unless you are playing with friends after the first 10 games. Its cool the game has new equipment and content but the base of the game is the ghosts and getting scared, it lost all of that novelty after an hour.",False,Strategy

A lot of fun when playing with friends, cant wait for the new updates coming throughout the year too! :D My only issue is probs on the larger maps, its so hard to get things moving along as the maps are super huge. :( But otherwise, great game and defo recommend!",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I really wanted to recommend this game, but the amount of time updates take to come out is far too slow; even for an indie dev company. They made millions off of this game alone, they have hired a few developers but so far thats about it. They have released updates to make the game better but the rate that these updates are coming out is slow. Even slower than many other indie games that made no where near what this game made but somehow they can release content at a faster pace.

Also if your going to add a progression system to this game, do it properly, not a slow and mediocre grind fest.",False,Strategy

I hate running lobbies now because once they get ingot your lobby you cannot kick them and they just follow you every time you try to make a new lobby. You report and block them and they just rejoin back into your lobby. I have stopped recommending this game to my friends because there are so many cheaters its hard to play.",False,Strategy

An Immersive and Terrifying Co-op Experience

Review Text:

    Phasmophobia is a thrilling co-op horror game where you and your friends investigate haunted locations. The atmosphere is genuinely creepy, and the unpredictable ghost behavior keeps every round exciting. Playing in VR adds another layer of immersion, making it even more terrifying. If you enjoy cooperative horror games, I highly recommend giving Phasmophobia a try!



",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,It's been a great experience to play this game with my friends. I highly recommend the game if you wanna just laugh and hear your friends scream. The only downside is I wish they had more maps to play and they would add a running stamina bar.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"A very attractive game in the genre of horror that is very entertaining. Anyone can spend hours with their mates with this  super attractive game. This is a new style in horror games and, I can honestly recommend it to all my friends.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,Love playing this game with friends. Jump scares as well as building scares. Once you play for a while it loses some of its creepiness but still makes for a good scare every now and then. Play with headphones and lights off for better atmosphere.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Spent 20 minutes laughing with my friend about the shovel spinning in the roof of the van , finally found the ghost type after another 20 , immediately died after that .
10/10 good game",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"The suction power of this vacuum is impressive. It effortlessly picks up dust, dirt, and even pet hair that I thought was embedded permanently in my carpets. It performs equally well on hardwood floors and carpets, seamlessly transitioning between the two without losing efficiency. For a fraction of the cost of a Dyson, I was skeptical at first, but it truly holds its own against the big-name brand.",True,Strategy

Get back to truck, he is dead. Left his corpse to rot next to the ghost and left map.

10/10 would do again. ( I refuse to step foot back into Sunny Meadows )",True,Strategy

Phasmophobia,very very fun game if you have friends this is the best game for you but solo play is pretty good,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"It's a good game, best to play with friends in multiplayer when you create/join a private room. When you first start playing it has that horror feel & still pretty easy after you've done the training but the more you play and get used to the different settings/difficulties it starts feeling more like a detective game and less scary. It's definitely tame in comparison to a lot of the newer horror games but it's fun and a solid game for it being older. If you can't find people to play with just join discords.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,This game has the best jump scares. They get me every time. Its so much fun to play with friends!,True,Strategy

do not play alone cuz very scary",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"The game is a lot of fun for me and my friends, especially because every round is scary in a different way.
At the beginning I was a bit scared and the investigations took longer, but now I'm hardened. The only thing that's a bit annoying is that you can't take any clear evidence seriously at the beginning, because the devices are very inaccurate at the beginning if they are not yet leveled accordingly. I can only recommend the game!
",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"When you play this game for the first time, it's really scary because the sounds are really well made. Everytime i heard a sound that is not natural, for example hissing or humming i immediately pressed Alt+F4. but I got used to it and only pressed it again when a hunt started. But i realized that the ghosts aren't that scary, they are pretty dumb and if you have incense then you are almost guaranteed to survive the hunt. Just ignite it and run into the ghost. The ghost will be blind and will not find you for a few seconds. The game is actually pretty easy, the trick is just to have enough incense and crucifixes. You will get used to it. Thank you for reading my opinion, good hunting!",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,It's such an addicting game and SO much fun trying to learn the different ghost types. Also just a great game to play with friends.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,Can be scary when first playing but after getting use to it not so much anymore. First game of it kind! Remember my friend asking me to get it many years ago. Glad I did.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,I think I got this game closer to it's initial release and played it a hand full of times. I would only come back during Halloween to get that spook in for the year. This last event was garbage though but I've been playing it increasingly more and more since then. 150+ hours at the time of writing this and it's still awesome to play with friends. We're always down for solving mysteries and that's what we get out of going in and hunting ghosties. If you're dying a lot to start then start by going in and thinking of where you'll hide if its starts hunting. Slowly progress up in difficulties once you get familiar with ghost types. Learn some ghost behaviors that have nothing to do with the evidence you're collecting and that's when you'll start dying less and leveling up more. I have done some nightmare modes where we just could not figure out the second clue. The ghost randomly shut the front door and we saw all we needed to see and dipped. (ONLY the Yurei can interact with the front door without a ghost event happening) I think the game gets a little less scary once you face the fears a few times but there are games where I looped a ghost in the kitchen then jumped at a ghost scare that popped up right in front of me.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I solidly don't recommend this game. 
It's peak has past. 
Go to one of the other games that are adjacent. 

When this game launched it was fantastic developer that cared and appreciated their community. Updating bugs almost the moment the community noticed them and the community requests were always the next update. 

Since getting a team on board they have split from the communities wants of more experience content and focused solely on new cosmetics and further updates towards the loom of the game and less about the actual spook of the game. 
They have dropped sever road maps including the horror 2.0 that people have heavy requested and pushed it back and back in favour of other minor things people don't want. 

As someone who enjoyed this game to the point of speed running it with mates and streaming it prior, seeing the devs cutting off any suggestions and doing what they want with no consideration of what we as a community ask for, as they currently don't even take suggestion feedback is a serious issue and down right a slap in the face to us who used to love it. 

I personally believe the main initial developer has lost any will or drive to make things happen in this game and has moved on or is getting told what to do and how to do it by their team and by other equity owners since incorporation.",False,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"The games Connection problems make this game borderline unplayable. Even if you Incense before it hunts, still die 90% of the time because of the delays and bugs. I love this game concept, but being a PVE game, why not have it run on Client side. I feel like  its a simple fix to most of the issues. It adds more hackers to the game but again, being a PVE style game, people can just kick or them. Iv already found multiple cheaters anyway with it being server based so its not like its unhackable now. Just makes the game unplayable unless your in US or UK. Iv reinstalled 5 times, tried every fix I can by using VPN's and DNS changes. Checked and changed firewall settings. Great with friends, but thats it. Developers direction is interesting but its not for me given the lack of information any reporting for an early access game.",False,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"super duper fun game and very scary !!!!
when ghost runs around corner i go like 0:
just kidding ;)",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,A strong co-op survival game that has continued to have loving care put into it for years. Looking forward to its future updates!,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"very fun to play with a group of friends, would recommend.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Still waiting for my prestige banner from before the rework.

Not a terrible game, but the direction it went depresses me. I feel like whenever titles like these hit that streamer sensation point developers start hearing ""Lose Yourself"" and bite off more than they can chew, hire a larger team before haphazardly reworking their game into something completely unrecognizable in the hopes of keeping around a crowd that was always going to leave to chase the next big thing. Logging in to see my progress wiped a second time on top of a seasonal event board sent me over. Why does a game like this need events?

The game's scare factor is strongest in its buildup, payoff is always variable. Hunts ultimately serve to the games detriment, the ghosts would be scariest if they were a constant but subtle threat killing players as a more unpredictable manner (still utilizing sanity). Hunts take that away by giving the game a clear ""YOU CAN DIE NOW"" sequence that kills all that tension that the game is so masterful at establishing and instead makes the game feel arcady. I understand why hunts exist from a progression standpoint (If players can lose their personal investment from dying you need gameplay to be somewhat predictable and to have a learning curve that can be mastered), but phasmophobia shouldn't be built from a progression first mindset.

Which is the problem in my eyes; the events, season map skins, constant equipment tweaking and balancing, and the clear focus on off-map progression makes the game feel like they are trying to develop a MP competitive grindfest like Dead by Daylight or Friday the 13th, and not a player focused HORROR game with no competitive mechanics. The game's focus should be on the moment to moment gameplay on a given map, not amassing resources to buy your next tier of equipment in the background.

Post rework (I'd say even as far back as when they added cursed items) this game lost its soul. The new asylum map in particular feels like something you'd see coming from a phasmophobia imitator and not from the OG itself in how over the top committed to horror tropes it is. The old asylum was a little bit much, but still gave the impression of having been a functional healthcare facility at one point. Beyond that it was fun to explore, like walking GM Krot. The new asylum would feel right at home in a Rob Zombie movie with how on the nose it is. My favorite level had always been the prison, because I believe this game's horror works best when in a clinical, lifelike, setting. I grew up watching ghost adventures and such, this game's original state felt perfectly suited to living out that larp. The current state of game, once again, reminds me more of games like Dead by Daylight where the developers intent of scaring you is completely secondary to the contained gameplay loop.

Anywho, I wish there was a neutral react. I gave it the blue thumb because I can bitch about the direction the game went all I want, it's 4 years old they haven't tried to milk me for any DLC. The primary loop is still fun enough, with enough of the old maps around that I can still play the game at its best, subtle.

The bar really is that low anymore. I swear it used to cost 14 bucks though, I wouldn't spend more than that on it but I could be misremembering.

The ghost identification gets more challenging as time goes on, with more types being unlocked as you level up, higher difficulties becoming options, and larger maps becoming available.

Phasmophobia,"This game is really fun once you get the hang of it, with a lot of replay-ability (especially with friends) with plenty of challenge to go around.  There have been a couple issues that I've seen though that may need to be advised on just to let others know, however.

One, even though this didn't happen to me, a friends voice recognition just stopped working altogether at some point, and he hasn't gotten it to work since.  Even though there is a workaround for any necessary voice related item in the game (such as the spirit box), the main issue remains broken.

Second, Kinetic Studio has been somewhat misleading with their roadmaps, promising things that haven't been implemented for a couple years at least.  Whether this is from false promises, or if it's taking much longer than anticipated and never telling the fanbase, it's still not a good look for them.

If this hasn't deterred anyone seeing this, it is still a fun game to pick up with friends and die a lot in the process!  Happy ghost hunting!",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,Phasmophobia is a great interactive game! Up to the amount of ghost types and the maps. the ingame voice chat is also pretty nice! im not just glazing this game- its actually really good and has the right amount of spook and sends shivers down your spine.

    My settings got reset or something when I entered the game after playing before as when I came back into the game my cursor options for opacity and size were 0 so I couldn't see the cursor at all
    Oil lanterns or lighting not connected to powered off generators turn off (I didn't realize oil/battery-powered lanterns were powered by generators)

Phasmophobia,Content is great fun game for playing with multiple friends good variety of maps and tools within the game,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I've been playing for a while and this game is worth it. With friends or alone, it's a very entertaining game. It has a lot to offer for both singleplayer and multiplayer experiences, including tasks, weekly to-dos, and hard challenges. To the ghosts, unique abilities, and the silly stuff, there's clearly a lot of love put into this game.

10/10! Would recommend for people who're looking for a good ghost-hunting game.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"TL:DR; This is a very fun [b]puzzle[/b] game with a few minor bumps in the way that don't detract from its overall fun.

For those who might be worried that this game is going to be super scary, it really isn't. Yes there's jump-scares that can be spooky at times, but it's more just the 'jump' part rather than the 'scare' part of that. Phasmophobia feels more like a puzzle game than it does a horror game. You're trying to find a ghost with the information they give you and once you find the three pieces you've got your ghost and you can get out. Playing on Nightmare is my favorite because you get an idea of what the ghost is but you can only get the last bit through the ghost's activity rather than trying to find the third bit of evidence.

While it is a very fun game and the puzzle aspect is very good, there are a couple points that kind of reduce my overall grade. There are some bugs when it comes to evidence collection; orbs sometimes just never seem to appear and the candlestick test for Goryo seems to randomly just not work. In addition, some rounds will be spent sitting and waiting for something - anything - to happen to give you either that last bit of evidence or that last objective on the board for a perfect investigation. Sitting in a dark room waiting for a ghost to do an event so you can get that perfect game just isn't fun. Some of the ghosts (like the Mare and Goryo) can be just irritating to guess because they're so generic it's hard to get the bits of evidence needed to guess them.

However, the way the game is designed it still remains an incredibly fun puzzle game so I absolutely recommend it. 4 stars out of 5, B+, 8/10.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"i would recommend this game but it is more fun with multiple players
not fun as solo",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I've been playing this game off and on for awhile now, and it's always fun when I come back to it. It's great and this game has given my dad and I a new Halloween tradition. Would definitely recommend unless you have neighbors that bang stuff around for an extra heart attack.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,its fun its a ghost game it gets old after about 15 matches in one sitting,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"This game is optimized very well!It runs on 60 fps with intel uhd 620 , intel uhd 620 and 8 gb ram.
It's quite scary even when played with friends.i ll give it 10/10
",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"It's a lot less scary than all the streamers make it out to be, but no less fun to chill out and play either alone or with friends!",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"It is a great game nice community if you have no one to play with and pretty fun, you learn new things on the way you play, don't recommend it if you are scared to play ""alone"" not a great game to be alone of course people who have 4000+ hours can do it alone but overall 5/5 recommend if you like solving things and scary games",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,so spooky and fun! It's more fun when you play with others! :D,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"very fun, strategic, and a little frightening! the perfect combination of every feeling a game should give you.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Even after a few hours in Phasmophobia, I still get the occasional scare, and that’s what makes it great! The atmosphere, random ghost behavior, and eerie sound design keep every hunt unpredictable! Just when I think I’ve got it figured out, the game finds a new way to creep me out. It’s an awesome blend of strategy and genuine horror—definitely worth playing!! 👻",True,Strategy

Phasmophobia,"Amazing game with a great active community. The gameplay nurtures and rewards personal skill development and has a fantastic custom challenge function. Great as multiplayer with friends or single player. Lots of great online advice, support and videos. Game is still developing and has lots of exciting features upcoming",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Can't recommend this game enough. Although it has its bugs and constant ""major updates' that only consists of minor details, I still love this game. I waited two years for the console release only to buy it, then three months latter build a PC and buy it again.",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I started playing the game by myself, it was not that great, but now i have people who plays with me. It's a great game if you have great company, especially when there's a loud friend who get's startled by even the tiniest sounds",True,Strategy

Contra Anniversary Collection,""" A Timeless Classic That Still Kick A$$!""

Wow, the Contra Anniversary Collection is pure retro greatness. Whether you grew up with these games or are just discovering them, this collection is an absolute blast. The fast-paced action, tight controls, and legendary difficulty make it just as thrilling today as it was decades ago.

From the original Contra to Hard Corps, every game in this collection is packed with non-stop action and that iconic run-and-gun gameplay that defined a genre. The classic 8-bit and 16-bit visuals still hold up, and the challenge is as addictive as ever. Playing through these legendary titles again in this day and age proves that Contra never gets old, just better with time.

A must-have for retro fans, arcade lovers, and anyone who enjoys pure, unfiltered action😁.

Contra Anniversary Collection,"Here it is! The Space Marine shooter 80s-90s supreme! The only one missing here for me is Contra:Force which was a 1992 NES release that added 4 different characters with different sets of weapons and styles. The original arcade versions are here, which is a plus. I can remember playing ""Ikari Warriors,"" ""Operation: Wolf,"" and ""Operation: Razorback,"" in the arcade as a child, but I never played the arcade version of Contra. 
Contra for the NES, however, is truly a force of nature in my life. Super C (NES) came a little later, without the Konami code.  Contra (NES) and James Cameron's Aliens made all the boys under the age of 12 in my neighborhood circa 1988-1990 want to be space marines. I was probably nine or eight years old the first time I played Contra on the ol' NES.  The music for the waterfall stage is my favorite. 
My best times and experiences playing my beloved Contra have come and gone but this collection is a worthy introduction to my career as a space marine. The only shooter to conquer and humiliate the ol' Contra games was, of course, DOOM. When the Mars Demonic invasion broke into gaming, everyone switched from the ol' Jungle/Snowfield/Energy Zone/Alien's Layer vision of Rambo Space Marines into the interdimensional/teleporting/stair climbing/barrel shooting/door opening salvo of the Rambo-one-man-army Doom Space Marine!!
Setting that aside, the fun and history is all here, except for Contra: Force (NES). I guess that one is the red-headed step child of Contra games. The Contra 3: The Alien Wars (SNES) 3 page comic book advertisement is among my favorites of all published advertising! That's sometimes the best part of an old comic book: the video game advertisements!
Contra was the NES game that united us all in the neighborhood circa 1987-1990. Sometimes even the older jocks would give us lil' kids respect for being able to pull off the Konami Code for the NES Contra, which was no easy feat! Ray Joseph and I spent ungodly ludicrous amounts of time attempting the Konami code on the NES so we could ""beat"" the game. I recall that you had to wait for the menu music to fully activate before you could do the ol' left-down-up-righ-A-B....err....you get the point. We were so terrible sometimes that when we did succeed in entering the code one of us would outlive the other and carry on until his lives ran out and then we could hit the continue option. We always wondered why one would want to select the End option over Continue. Remember there was only 2 continues, and 30 lives per successful finishing of Contra (NES) so in time I must have died at least ninety times on Contra over the years...at least that I can recall.
 I also have vague but wonderful memories of playing Contra 3 on the SNES with my best neighborhood buddy Ray Joseph. The addition of gernades was awesome to us both, but I was also pleased and impressed by the speed of the bullets in the regular starting rifle, much less the amazing fire effects in the first stage....Contra 3 totally blew our pre-adolescent hair back with a vengeance back in the day!
On the other side of the 16 bit wars,  somewhere in my gaming archives I still have an EGM magazine issue that contains the review for Contra: Hard Corps on the ol' Genesis, which is a most welcome member here. Konami is really the hero for this beloved series. You can really see things evolve here in this collection.
 Super C was really the one that broke me on difficulty. My friend Nelson and I rented Super C (NES) from Blockbuster back in 1990-1991 and proceeded to have both our pre-adolescent bodies drawn and quartered. To this day I can still hear the death jingle in my mind with a strange nostalgic affection! Contra is as unforgiving as it is nostalgic, violent, and beloved in my warped old school gamer brains! At heart there will always be a tiny part of me runnin' 'round with the spread gun saving Earth from alien invasion!",True,Strategy

Contra (NES) and James Cameron's Aliens made all the boys under the age of 12 in my neighborhood circa 1988-1990 want to be space marines. I was probably nine or eight years old the first time I played Contra on the ol' NES.  The music for the waterfall stage is my favorite. 
My best times and experiences playing my beloved Contra have come and gone but this collection is a worthy introduction to my career as a space marine. The only shooter to conquer and humiliate the ol' Contra games was, of course, DOOM. When the Mars Demonic invasion broke into gaming, everyone switched from the ol' Jungle/Snowfield/Energy Zone/Alien's Layer vision of Rambo Space Marines into the interdimensional/teleporting/stair climbing/barrel shooting/door opening salvo of the Rambo-one-man-army Doom Space Marine!!
Setting that aside, the fun and history is all here, except for Contra: Force (NES). I guess that one is the red-headed step child of Contra games. The Contra 3: The Alien Wars (SNES) 3 page comic book advertisement is among my favorites of all published advertising! That's sometimes the best part of an old comic book: the video game advertisements!
Contra was the NES game that united us all in the neighborhood circa 1987-1990. Sometimes even the older jocks would give us lil' kids respect for being able to pull off the Konami Code for the NES Contra, which was no easy feat! Ray Joseph and I spent ungodly ludicrous amounts of time attempting the Konami code on the NES so we could ""beat"" the game. I recall that you had to wait for the menu music to fully activate before you could do the ol' left-down-up-righ-A-B....err....you get the point. We were so terrible sometimes that when we did succeed in entering the code one of us would outlive the other and carry on until his lives ran out and then we could hit the continue option. We always wondered why one would want to select the End option over Continue. Remember there was only 2 continues, and 30 lives per successful finishing of Contra (NES) so in time I must have died at least ninety times on Contra over the years...at least that I can recall.
 I also have vague but wonderful memories of playing Contra 3 on the SNES with my best neighborhood buddy Ray Joseph. The addition of gernades was awesome to us both, but I was also pleased and impressed by the speed of the bullets in the regular starting rifle, much less the amazing fire effects in the first stage....Contra 3 totally blew our pre-adolescent hair back with a vengeance back in the day!
On the other side of the 16 bit wars,  somewhere in my gaming archives I still have an EGM magazine issue that contains the review for Contra: Hard Corps on the ol' Genesis, which is a most welcome member here. Konami is really the hero for this beloved series. You can really see things evolve here in this collection.
 Super C was really the one that broke me on difficulty. My friend Nelson and I rented Super C (NES) from Blockbuster back in 1990-1991 and proceeded to have both our pre-adolescent bodies drawn and quartered. To this day I can still hear the death jingle in my mind with a strange nostalgic affection! Contra is as unforgiving as it is nostalgic, violent, and beloved in my warped old school gamer brains! At heart there will always be a tiny part of me runnin' 'round with the spread gun saving Earth from alien invasion!",True,Strategy

Contra Anniversary Collection,"This is a review purely on the topic of Contra, not the port or other unrelated things.

The idea is great, but the execution is needlessly focussed on the hardcore audience, ruining the experience. Even though all the games have an easy setting, it hardly seems to matter. The general formula is that you die in one hit. Die three times and you have to start the [b] entire[/b] game over, which is ludicrous, and it's very telling that the gaming industry has moved far away from such egregious progression wipes once the 8 bit era came to a close.

If you're a masochist who enjoys replaying the same levels over and over until you can do it blindfolded, this game's for you. For the more casual gamers, stay away from this one and get it on an emulator instead so you can at least save your game.",False,Strategy

Contra Anniversary Collection,""" A Timeless Classic That Still Kick A$$!""

Wow, the Contra Anniversary Collection is pure retro greatness. Whether you grew up with these games or are just discovering them, this collection is an absolute blast. The fast-paced action, tight controls, and legendary difficulty make it just as thrilling today as it was decades ago.

From the original Contra to Hard Corps, every game in this collection is packed with non-stop action and that iconic run-and-gun gameplay that defined a genre. The classic 8-bit and 16-bit visuals still hold up, and the challenge is as addictive as ever. Playing through these legendary titles again in this day and age proves that Contra never gets old, just better with time.

A must-have for retro fans, arcade lovers, and anyone who enjoys pure, unfiltered action😁.

The hidden rewards and endless variety of cookie flavors keep me hooked, and the graphics are delightfully charming. The background music is super relaxing and it's the perfect game to run while you're busy with other tasks at home.

One of the highlights for me is the mini-game of clicking on the golden cookies that appear at random times. It's such a simple yet satisfying feature that adds an extra layer of fun. 

I genuinely enjoy every second spent playing Cookie Clicker, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cute, yet time consuming game.",True,Strategy

it's still a fun time, but i don't recommend because it looks like the save system is prone to errors.

i logged in today to find out that the save's been wiped. the latest steam cloud backup available on my account is from a week ago ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ a quick google search shows this is a pretty common occurrence, and looks like folks who are really into this game manually backup their saves by exporting the save.",False,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"very good game, takes a while for 100 percent achievements but autoclicker helps (dont like the grandmas)",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"First off, I want to say: What an amazing game.
This game offers so much to uncover and do within it's game-play, it is pretty much endless. Price-wise it's decent, but I definitely recommend waiting for it to go on sale before you buy, mainly because it's simply an Idle game and it is 100% free to play online. Just looking at the game one might say to themselves ""This looks a tad boring,"" but after playing the game for just minutes you will become hooked. There are so many little Easter eggs, mini games, upgrades and achievements to unlock and so much fun to be had. Overall I'd recommend this game, and love to play it myself.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"A fun game, but be careful. It is hard to concentrate on anything else since a Golden Cookie might be lurking in the background waiting to be clicked on for a huge bonus. If you want to play another game or watch a movie on the PC, you will also want to alt-tab into Cookie Clicker every so often. If you really like cookies and want to permanently divide your attention, or if you are not a completionist, this has my recommendation!",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"Worth the price (only 2 euros on sale), legimately up there as one of the best idlers. What can I say, I love lots of achievements and they are placed so you get them steadily throughout the game. Still, I recommend getting ascension helper through steam workshop (the 1000 ascensions will be a major pain in the ass without). And in general, its has been made nicely easy to mod the game via the workshop and modding settings put into the games settings.
   Now don't get me even started on the music. Fucking beautiful to listen at for hours to end, made by the same guy who composed most of Minecraft's music.
  If you are into idlers, I can only recommend Cookie clicker <3.",True,Strategy
Cookie Clicker,"I really want to love this game, I really do. But after 200 hours I feel bored and don't want to play anymore. In fact I should've stopped hours ago. 

Sugar lumps take 24 hours to grow. The fastest way to get them is apparently to max out the garden. But good luck doing that as that's one of the rariest achivements. 

Once you get into the hundreds of trillions of heavenly chips, jusst stop playing. Your production of heavenly chips will never go up past this point and upgrades now cost 100s of trillions of heavenly chips so maybe if your lucky you'll get like one bleeping upgrade. 

The stock market is complete and total BS, so why even use it. 

You will quickly get sick of not being able to buy anything once you are at a certain point in the game. Legacy levels don't help you get further. It feels like the game is unfinished and they never came up with an end game. 

Overall, just play for maybe 100-150 and give up. I wasted a good 50-100 hours expecting more of an end game and there wasn't anything else to experience. You will never get that feeling of ""wow I finished the game."" More like ""I'm done I hate this now, I'm bored."" And yes the whole point is that it's endless but even in something like minecraft(before ya know ender dragon and an ending) you'd be so rich and full of diamonds that you'd feel that sense of pride afterwards. 

The garden is honestly the second worse feature of this game. Plants can take six hours to grow, take forever to mutate and you will never get any real bonuses out of them unless you spend another 800 hours so good luck. Oh and the genius devs decided that you should lose all your plants when you legacy with no upgrade that makes it so they stay. Because god forbid, you could have fun. 

The sugar lump situation. Seriously, one of the most powerful upgrades in the game gives you +5 percent click percentage each level up. problem, you will never level up your crusors to level 20.

In the beginning you click the cookie - which gets you one cookie
You click again, you've got two. then three.

become popular in the neighbourhood , then renowned all over town . Production accelerates

You buy cookie farms to grow cookies, mines to extract cookies from the earth, factories
to produce cookies on an industrial scale.
The cookie economy transforms the world around it – chocolate pollutes the rivers , there’s
an obesity epidemic . But the world is too hooked on cookies to stop – economists say
that “""cookies permeate the economy"", and ""If we start eating anything else, we're all
dead"" ”. Cookie banks start using cookies as currency . At temples, thousands pray to
the Baker in the sky . There is no value, no ideology, and no meaning beyond cookies.
You produce hundreds of thousands of cookies a second, straining the fabric of reality
itself . You build wizard towers and alchemy labs to summon cookies magically, you fly
in shipments from space of cookies from alien worlds.
You open portals to a parallel dimension, taking in millions of cookies per second.
Alien beings and cosmic elder gods come to taste your cookies , and whole cities are
engulfed in transdimensional disaster , but the system can’t stop, it can only grow,
cookies are all we know.",True,Strategy

Cookie Clicker,"In the world of video games, the term “action-packed” often evokes images of fast-paced shooters, complex strategy games, and high-octane gameplay that keep players on the edge of their seats. However, one game that defies conventional expectations is Cookie Clicker, a seemingly innocuous, idle clicker game that involves baking cookies. Despite its unassuming nature, Cookie Clicker has had a profound and transformative impact on my life, leading me to adopt new ways of thinking, improve my time management, and build habits that have shaped my personal growth. It’s not just a game about clicking cookies—it’s a powerful reflection of the value of incremental progress, strategic planning, and patience, all of which have translated into my everyday experiences.

When I first stumbled upon Cookie Clicker, I wasn’t expecting much. I thought it would be a simple distraction, a game to kill time during breaks. Little did I know that it would soon become an essential part of my daily routine, providing me with more than just entertainment—it offered life lessons that have deeply influenced my perspective on work, productivity, and personal growth. The mechanics of Cookie Clicker—constant incremental rewards, resource management, and long-term strategy—are surprisingly effective in teaching important skills that extend beyond gaming. While the concept of an idle game where you bake cookies may sound absurd, it has become clear to me that the game’s underlying principles mirror many aspects of real life.

In this essay, I will explore how Cookie Clicker has impacted my life in ways I never expected. From shaping my time management habits to fostering emotional resilience, this game has provided valuable insights that I carry with me into every day. By reflecting on the game’s psychological elements, the skills it has helped me develop, and the unexpected benefits it has brought, I aim to show how a simple idle clicker game has, in fact, changed my life for the better.

Section 1: The Psychology of Incremental Progress
One of the key aspects of Cookie Clicker that drew me in was its reliance on incremental progress. In the game, players click on a giant cookie to earn more cookies, which are then used to buy upgrades that further increase cookie production. This seemingly simple mechanic is underpinned by one of the most fundamental psychological principles in human behavior: the power of small wins.

The concept of incremental progress is powerful in that it taps into a deep-seated human desire for achievement. In Cookie Clicker, every click, every upgrade, and every milestone provides a reward, no matter how small. This constant feedback loop keeps players engaged, ensuring that they feel a sense of accomplishment even during short sessions. For me, this was a revelation. In the past, I often struggled to stay motivated on long-term projects because the results were not immediately visible. Cookie Clicker, with its quick and consistent rewards, helped me understand the importance of small, consistent steps in achieving a larger goal.

Psychologically, this is tied to the concept of “intermittent reinforcement,” a principle from behavioral psychology that explains how unpredictably timed rewards can lead to stronger, more persistent behavior. In Cookie Clicker, although there are constant rewards, some of the most significant milestones—like unlocking a new upgrade or reaching a high number of cookies—are spaced out over time. This unpredictability kept me coming back for more, and, over time, I began to apply the same principle to my real-life endeavors. Instead of waiting for big rewards to validate my efforts, I learned to appreciate the small wins along the way, whether they were minor accomplishments at work or simple improvements in my personal development.

Moreover, the game’s structure taught me that progress is not always linear. In Cookie Clicker, as you progress, you can experience periods where your production slows down, and it may feel like you’re not making as much progress as you’d hoped. This was particularly true when I hit certain milestones and realized that my next big upgrade would require exponentially more cookies. At first, this felt like a discouraging setback, but over time, I learned to appreciate the slower periods as opportunities to reflect and strategize. This mirrored experiences in my own life where progress was not always as fast as I wanted it to be, but instead of becoming frustrated, I learned to embrace the process.

As a result, the psychology of incremental progress in Cookie Clicker has become an invaluable lesson for me. It taught me that success is built on a foundation of consistent, small efforts, rather than waiting for a single, grand achievement. By breaking larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, I was able to stay motivated and build momentum in areas such as work, fitness, and even personal relationships.

This section will delve into how Cookie Clicker helped me balance leisure time with productivity, teaching me how to structure my day effectively.

Section 3: The Power of Strategy and Planning
Here, I will explore the strategic elements of Cookie Clicker and how they taught me to make informed, long-term decisions in real life.

Section 4: Coping with Stress and Finding Balance
This section will discuss how the game’s meditative qualities helped me deal with stress and practice mindfulness.

Section 5: The Social Aspect and Community
I will reflect on how the Cookie Clicker community, despite the game being mostly single-player, influenced my social interactions and sense of connection.

In this part, I will discuss how playing the game fostered emotional resilience and helped me see life’s challenges from a different perspective.

Mafia: Definitive Edition,"[h1]Mafia: Definitive Edition[/h1]
[h3][Positives][/h3]
- Mostly faithful remake. It’s pretty neat to see all the iconic scenes are areas recreated.
- Solid story which has been expanded from the original. Most of the additions are really good.
- Good characters.
- Decent gameplay.
- Good pacing.
- Memorable missions.
- Tons of vehicles and solid driving mechanics.
- Great graphics and art style.
- Much more polished than the original game.
- A lot of padding was cut that was in the original.
- Cars are stored in an infinite garage now, so you don’t need to sacrifice cars when you unlock new ones.
- Paulie and Sam are more present in this game compared to the original, which helps flesh their characters out more. Other characters are expanded upon as well.

[h3][Mixed][/h3]
- Some missions were shortened from the original game, but also some missions were expanded.
- Some story details were changed. You may or may not like the changes, but I think they’re mostly fine.
-The game does a better job at directing the player compared to the original game, but sometimes this goes a little too far and makes the game feel too linear and hand holding.
- The open world is neat, but it’s pretty shallow. This isn’t a deal-breaker given that the game is mostly linear.
- The stealth mechanics are a bit better, but now they’re fairly generic. There’s no more hitting enemies with baseball bats from behind to knock them out. Now you just have a typical ‘Press B from behind’ takedown system.
- Cover mechanics in the combat are a questionable inclusion.
- The shooting while driving mechanics are still a bit clunky, so it’s a bit of a sidegrade.
- The Lucas Bertore sub-quests from the original games story were exchanged for free roam side missions instead.

[h3][Negatives][/h3]
- Combat and gunplay feel more generic compared to the original game. Most weapons feel worse than the original. The Tommy Gun being one of the most noticeable downgrades.
- The game was made significantly easier compared to the original. I’d recommend playing on Hard or Classic.
- The racing mission is notoriously difficult, especially on Classic difficulty.
- Some of the chase sequences are pretty scripted.
- Some of the collectibles are neat, but there’s too many of them and the in-game methods of tracking them are incredibly lacking.
- Various downgrades from the original. The city is a bit less interactive, being able to freely ride public transport was removed, car damage isn’t as impressive, some of the immersion feels weaker. The original game also felt fairly advanced for it’s time, this remake feels a bit too safe and generic in some ways.

[h3][Conclusion][/h3]
Mafia: Definitive Edition isn’t without it’s faults. But overall it’s a really solid remake and I would consider it to be (mostly) an improvement over the original. It’s not super replayable, but it’s definitely worth a shot for the story alone.
8/10

Mafia: Definitive Edition,"So... I just finished the main story. This was my second time playing Mafia; the last time was probably about 10 years ago. The developers managed to perfectly capture the atmosphere of the 1930s. The storyline is stunning, and you can really connect with the characters. Small details, like how driving through a tunnel changes how the car radio works or how your aim becomes unsteady while moving, add so much depth. The variety of cars is impressive, with each one feeling unique. The voice acting is top-notch, and the roadblocks are cleverly designed, with one car always ready to chase you. The music during action sequences and the car radio, playing classy '30s music while driving through the city, adds to the immersion. Everything I mentioned, along with thousands of other details, makes you feel like you're truly part of the story. This is a perfect example of how to do a proper remake.

Everything feels so real and lifelike. The music is amazing, the sounds fit so well, and the lighting is gorgeous it's really amazing. Feels like I'm playing a crime film. Each character was fun and cool. I liked Paulie and Sam's banter with each other and Tommy. I wish some characters were explored more, like Ralph and Vincenzo, especially Vincenzo who's probably my personal favorite character besides Paulie. Tommy himself is an alright protaganist, I don't really have any issue with him. The models look really good, each character has easy to understand personalities and quirks, and the voices are really nice. The gameplay was fun, nothing too major. I'm a big fan of the car limiter thing, never seen another game do that. Shooting feels nice, running feels snappy and responsive, I like that you have to dodge attacks. No complaints in terms of gameplay. ALSO I especially love the signs that appear in game with your gps, that is so smart. Story was fun and good, it had cool quirky moments I like it.

Pros
====
- Amazing Graphics. Especially the night it looks awesome!
- Weather and Lighting are very well done!
- Great level design, the city feels alive!
- Good storyline! And it gives you the vibe that you actually are in a Mafia!
- World feels Alive! 
- AI is good. Watch out speeding as well!
- Great mission variety. All seem to be well designed and not tedious.
- All main characters are interesting and memorable (unlike most games!)
- Peak Fashion!
- Good lighting design. Now that's something I almost never mention, but it feels very good in this game in most levels and locations!
- Gunplay is fluid and feels realistic (especially not having the usual dot aim which forces you to lose some aim)
- Great Music!
- Animations are great but death animations are chef's kiss!
- Νο ""highlight sense/scan"". Yes that's a good thing because almost all newer games seem to have it and it's refreshing not to have it!
- Excellent dialogue and voice acting!
- Epic loading screens!
- Complete Story Arc and an emotional rollercoaster that fits a gangster's story!
- Get to walk a girl home like a real gentleman.
- Get to drive a racecar in a fricking tough race (and win!)
- Become part of the family.

Cons
====
- Short game. But still totally worths it!
- No photo mode! So many amazing scenes and not way to properly capture them :(

Mafia: Definitive Edition,"Great story and voice acting with this game. This was the first time I played this game, and I had already played 2 and 3. The game's video and sound are superb and it plays in ultra wide screen nativley with no artifacts/stretching. Controls are pretty decent on the xbox controller. 
I really have no complaints at all and had a great time playing this. It only took me 14 hours to complete it, so I guess that might be my only complaint.

Mafia: Definitive Edition,"Only recommend this at a steep discount. Game is basically a walking/escort simulator. While the main story is good, you would be better off just watching the synopsis on youtube or reading about it. There a two game modes, the story mode and free roam, why they didn't combine it I have no idea. Story mode is linear where you walk or drive from point A, to point B and do some shooting at some point. Free roam is just a waste of time where you go around collecting useless cards that add no benefit to the game play. There are no side missions, no enemy businesses to burn down, just the main story line, which is just a recap from the main character at how he got to his present situation. Compared to the Godfather game, which I believe came out roughly around the same time(for the original Mafia game), it is an inferior product. Remastered looks nice though and the voice acting is good.",False,Strategy
Mafia: Definitive Edition,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is an absolute masterpiece, delivering a stunning, immersive, and cinematic experience that surpasses all expectations. From the very first mission to the emotional finale, everything about this game is fantastically crafted.

Story – A Timeless Classic
The story is phenomenal—a gripping, emotional, and beautifully told journey through the life of Tommy Angelo, a cab driver who finds himself pulled into the dangerous world of organized crime. Every moment is captivating, with twists and turns that keep you fully invested. It’s a story about loyalty, power, and betrayal, and it’s told with such depth and emotion that it makes you want to keep playing non-stop.

Characters – Engaging and Unforgettable
The characters are fantastic. Tommy is a deeply relatable protagonist, and his transformation throughout the game is incredibly well-executed. The side characters are just as strong, with figures like Paulie, Sam, and Don Salieri bringing the world to life with their distinct personalities and relationships. Every interaction is meaningful, and the voice acting is top-notch, making every conversation feel natural and engaging.

Gameplay & World – A Beautifully Realized 1930s City
The world of Lost Heaven is breathtaking. The level of detail in the city, from the vintage cars to the period-accurate architecture, creates an immersive experience that feels like stepping back in time. The driving mechanics, gunplay, and hand-to-hand combat are all well-balanced and feel rewarding. Even though the game follows a linear story, every mission is exciting and diverse, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Final Thoughts
Mafia: Definitive Edition is a perfect remake of a classic, with a stunning world, an unforgettable story, and incredibly well-developed characters. Everything is done with care and attention to detail, making it one of the best story-driven games I’ve ever played. If you love cinematic storytelling, immersive worlds, and thrilling action, this is a must-play. Absolutely fantastic!",True,Strategy

Regardless of how it is compared to other entries in the series, I genuinely enjoyed the game. It gave me the feeling of watching a well-written classic mafia movie with playable action-packed moments. The main story was relatively short, but it never felt boring. While I did encounter a few glitches and crashes, they weren’t severe enough to negatively impact my overall experience.

From my perspective, this game shouldn’t be expected to play like GTA. It has its own unique gameplay style, which I found to be an interesting parallel to GTA. To fully appreciate it, I had to adjust my approach to how I typically play open-world games like GTA—but thankfully, that was a quick adjustment.

-Graphics are really beautiful, switched settings from high to medium and did not see any difference, still looked crispy.
-Driving is good, could go around drifting corners forever although most vehicles felt the same (except trucks & motorbikes)
-Gunfights feel good, melee fights are bit goofy and pretty easy if you spam 'q' with occasional dodge if not attacking first

I could comment on story (don't get me wrong, it's good but part close to ending feels bit abrupt) and weapons variety but I know this is a remaster of a game that was released back when ps2 was current so I won't go into detail. Overall I enjoyed it, recommend especially if Mafia trilogy is on sale.

Mafia: Definitive Edition,"As always, when i was a kid, i tried playing the original mafia, but i looked at it with a perspective of it being GTA, literally. Considering the fact that GTA was more of an open world game than original mafia, i did not enjoy it what so ever. After a few missions, i gave up on it. It has been 6 years since than, if not even more. 

Mafia Trilogy has always popped up on my for you page, whilst searching for games to buy. It has never crossed my mind to eventually buy it, but one faithful day, i decided to open it and when i realized that i was getting 4 different games for 6 dollars, i told myself, why not? Bought it all, played this first and, oh, man, it was amazing!

The game feels like a movie, there are a lot of scenes of talking, discussing plans of robbery, killing, stealing and so on. If your brain is too ""cooked"" and your attention spam is little, i am not sure if it's for you or not. In general, story revolves around four main character that are: Don Salieri, Tommy, Sam and Paulie. I won't spoil much of anything, but from the beginning Tommy (you) is introduced to the gang by accident, then all of you get along and start to fight off other Dons in the city. Man, there is just so much to the story and so much i could tell, but you have to experience it yourself. 

Graphics are spot on, voice acting is freaking amazing, story telling is perfect, gun play is alright, driving feels smooth. Just buy the whole trilogy on a sale and trust me, you will not be disappointed. This is one of the best games i have played, hands down. Honestly 10/10.",True,Strategy

Mafia: Definitive Edition,"As a huge fan of the original that I fondly remember playing at a quite young age and replayed few times after that, I was skeptical of this remake for a long time and unfortunately it did disappoint me in the ways I had anticipated, but I still recommend this game if you treat it like a standalone piece. It`s like meeting your teenage love in 20 years, something magnetic is still there to form a connection, but overall it will never be the same and you have to leave those good days back there in your memory.  The biggest changes/downsides have been pointed out hundreds of times, so won`t dwell on that, IMHO the biggest sad moment would be that they created a truly beautiful environment, a city that feels alive, yet so little of it is used in the game. Obviously there is no DLC coming at this age, so no extra missions or anything to utilize the work put into this.

At the beginning I was a bit scared and the investigations took longer, but now I'm hardened.

Phasmophobia,"When you play this game for the first time, it's really scary because the sounds are really well made. Everytime i heard a sound that is not natural, for example hissing or humming i immediately pressed Alt+F4. but I got used to it and only pressed it again when a hunt started. But i realized that the ghosts aren't that scary, they are pretty dumb and if you have incense then you are almost guaranteed to survive the hunt. Just ignite it and run into the ghost. The ghost will be blind and will not find you for a few seconds. The game is actually pretty easy, the trick is just to have enough incense and crucifixes. You will get used to it. Thank you for reading my opinion, good hunting!",True,Strategy

Phasmophobia,I think I got this game closer to it's initial release and played it a hand full of times. I would only come back during Halloween to get that spook in for the year. This last event was garbage though but I've been playing it increasingly more and more since then. 150+ hours at the time of writing this and it's still awesome to play with friends. We're always down for solving mysteries and that's what we get out of going in and hunting ghosties. If you're dying a lot to start then start by going in and thinking of where you'll hide if its starts hunting. Slowly progress up in difficulties once you get familiar with ghost types. Learn some ghost behaviors that have nothing to do with the evidence you're collecting and that's when you'll start dying less and leveling up more. I have done some nightmare modes where we just could not figure out the second clue. The ghost randomly shut the front door and we saw all we needed to see and dipped. (ONLY the Yurei can interact with the front door without a ghost event happening) I think the game gets a little less scary once you face the fears a few times but there are games where I looped a ghost in the kitchen then jumped at a ghost scare that popped up right in front of me.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I solidly don't recommend this game. 
It's peak has past. 
Go to one of the other games that are adjacent. 

When this game launched it was fantastic developer that cared and appreciated their community. Updating bugs almost the moment the community noticed them and the community requests were always the next update. 

Since getting a team on board they have split from the communities wants of more experience content and focused solely on new cosmetics and further updates towards the loom of the game and less about the actual spook of the game. 
They have dropped sever road maps including the horror 2.0 that people have heavy requested and pushed it back and back in favour of other minor things people don't want. 

As someone who enjoyed this game to the point of speed running it with mates and streaming it prior, seeing the devs cutting off any suggestions and doing what they want with no consideration of what we as a community ask for, as they currently don't even take suggestion feedback is a serious issue and down right a slap in the face to us who used to love it. 

I personally believe the main initial developer has lost any will or drive to make things happen in this game and has moved on or is getting told what to do and how to do it by their team and by other equity owners since incorporation.",False,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"The games Connection problems make this game borderline unplayable. Even if you Incense before it hunts, still die 90% of the time because of the delays and bugs. I love this game concept, but being a PVE game, why not have it run on Client side. I feel like  its a simple fix to most of the issues. It adds more hackers to the game but again, being a PVE style game, people can just kick or them. Iv already found multiple cheaters anyway with it being server based so its not like its unhackable now. Just makes the game unplayable unless your in US or UK. Iv reinstalled 5 times, tried every fix I can by using VPN's and DNS changes. Checked and changed firewall settings. Great with friends, but thats it.

Phasmophobia,"Still waiting for my prestige banner from before the rework.

Not a terrible game, but the direction it went depresses me. I feel like whenever titles like these hit that streamer sensation point developers start hearing ""Lose Yourself"" and bite off more than they can chew, hire a larger team before haphazardly reworking their game into something completely unrecognizable in the hopes of keeping around a crowd that was always going to leave to chase the next big thing. Logging in to see my progress wiped a second time on top of a seasonal event board sent me over. Why does a game like this need events?

The game's scare factor is strongest in its buildup, payoff is always variable. Hunts ultimately serve to the games detriment, the ghosts would be scariest if they were a constant but subtle threat killing players as a more unpredictable manner (still utilizing sanity). Hunts take that away by giving the game a clear ""YOU CAN DIE NOW"" sequence that kills all that tension that the game is so masterful at establishing and instead makes the game feel arcady. I understand why hunts exist from a progression standpoint (If players can lose their personal investment from dying you need gameplay to be somewhat predictable and to have a learning curve that can be mastered), but phasmophobia shouldn't be built from a progression first mindset.

Which is the problem in my eyes; the events, season map skins, constant equipment tweaking and balancing, and the clear focus on off-map progression makes the game feel like they are trying to develop a MP competitive grindfest like Dead by Daylight or Friday the 13th, and not a player focused HORROR game with no competitive mechanics. The game's focus should be on the moment to moment gameplay on a given map, not amassing resources to buy your next tier of equipment in the background.

Post rework (I'd say even as far back as when they added cursed items) this game lost its soul. The new asylum map in particular feels like something you'd see coming from a phasmophobia imitator and not from the OG itself in how over the top committed to horror tropes it is. The old asylum was a little bit much, but still gave the impression of having been a functional healthcare facility at one point. Beyond that it was fun to explore, like walking GM Krot. The new asylum would feel right at home in a Rob Zombie movie with how on the nose it is. My favorite level had always been the prison, because I believe this game's horror works best when in a clinical, lifelike, setting. I grew up watching ghost adventures and such, this game's original state felt perfectly suited to living out that larp. The current state of game, once again, reminds me more of games like Dead by Daylight where the developers intent of scaring you is completely secondary to the contained gameplay loop.

Anywho, I wish there was a neutral react. I gave it the blue thumb because I can bitch about the direction the game went all I want, it's 4 years old they haven't tried to milk me for any DLC. The primary loop is still fun enough, with enough of the old maps around that I can still play the game at its best, subtle.

The bar really is that low anymore. I swear it used to cost 14 bucks though, I wouldn't spend more than that on it but I could be misremembering.

Positives
+ Gameplay is still very much the same as the original - there are no major overhauls of the core mechanics which made previous renditions great

+ The ability to queue both units and technologies simultaneously
+ The ability to indefinitely re-seed farms and fish traps if you have the available resources
+ Several new units and technologies (such as the Steppe Lancer and Supplies) to balance existing civilisations and provide new ways to play
+ Multiple new single-player / multi-player lobby options, such as game speed, map pool, AI difficulty and type (such as the 'new' AI for Definitive Edition, or the HD and CD AI)
+ You can use the lobby browser for multi-player while waiting in a lobby
+ Your multi-player game stats are tracked, and you can earn player profile pictures from time played, number of victories etc.
+ Improved visual effects (such as collapsing structures, improved unit models and environmental / lighting effects)
+ Improved sound effects, whilst remaining true to the charm of classic Age of Empires II (units have their original voice lines and so on)
+ Massive update to AI commanding in single player games - you can now use the taunt/command system to tell your AI allies to train specific types of units, construct buildings on a flare marker, attack a specific target and so on
+ Several new civilisations with their own unique units
+ Several new historical campaigns
+ Massive improvement to the tutorial system, with new scenarios (Art of War) specifically catered to helping new players deal with managing economies, performing and defending from rushing, etc.
+ Tweaks to the scenario editor (such as copy-pasting event triggers)
+ In-house mod support (Steam workshop has been removed in favour, could be interpreted as a negative)
+ Xbox LIVE profile support and cross-play
+ A ton of different settings to customise your gameplay experience by tweaking controls, graphics, sound and so on (several of these settings also make the game more accessible for individuals experiencing difficulty from handicaps such as colour blindness etc.)
+ Dedicated servers, and private multi-player games appear to run much smoother than HD
+ Steam achievements and trading cards

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,"After playing more than 2000 hours since the definite edition came out i might write a recommendation.
I knew the AOE-Franchise from my childhood but i didnt touch the game in 15 years. 
THe new definitve edition and a friend of mine brought me back to the game and after a stresful learning curve i have to say its worth the time. im speaking mainly from a competitive player perspective in pvp. compared to other rts macro and strategy are more important than just microing the units. graphics are very nice, even better than aoe4 when you talk about visibility and clearnes for pvp-play. best thing is, the global community is really nice, nothing in comparison to LoL, cs or other big pvp-online-games. 
also you can find lot of content on twitch and youtube. i recommend t90official and spiritofthelaw for a start. 

one last note to the ranking-system: for beginners i highly recommend to play some pve first but then dont be afraid to start in the ranking-matches and skip the normal game-mod in pvp. yes you will lose the first 10-20 games, but the elo-system will give you fitting opponents after that. smurf-accounts may occur but should be a rarity in age. 
when you play normal-pvp ""quickplay"" the difference between players skill can vary alot. so as a beginner: just dont do that. 

if your not into competitive rts the game propably still is way worth the money. there is alot alot alot (!) of campaign-content when you buy the full game-package. with the difficulty on easy you can also enjoy the storylines and dont have to sweat to hard. :-) and just by the way you can play aoe1 within the aoe2-game.

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition (AoE2: DE) 

Can significantly improve your cognitive abilities in various ways:

1. Strategic Thinking & Decision-Making
You need to plan economy, military, and expansion strategies in real time.
Balancing resources, army composition, and scouting opponents enhances long-term thinking.

2. Multitasking & Time Management
Managing villagers, military production, and battles simultaneously sharpens multitasking.
Prioritizing tasks (e.g., booming economy vs. early aggression) improves time efficiency.

3. Problem-Solving & Adaptability
Adjusting strategies based on enemy tactics teaches flexible problem-solving.
Countering different civilizations and strategies improves analytical thinking.

4. Memory & Information Processing
Remembering civilization bonuses, unit counters, and build orders enhances memory retention.
Quickly interpreting map layouts and opponent movements sharpens pattern recognition.

5. Hand-Eye Coordination & Reflexes
Fast-paced micromanagement during battles improves coordination and reaction speed.
Hotkeys and rapid decision execution boost motor skills.

6. Patience & Mental Endurance
Longer matches require sustained focus, boosting concentration and endurance.
Losing and learning from mistakes enhances resilience and adaptability.

Coordinating with teammates improves leadership and cooperative skills.
Understanding roles in team games helps with delegation and strategy execution.

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,"This edition has good graphics, and the expansions are cool. However I think the HD edition is better simply due to the AI issues.   AoE2 is probably the most popular AoE game, and for good reason. The campaigns are quite well written and extensive (hours and hours of gameplay now) and the multiplayer is great for competition. 

However, the biggest downside with this particular edition is its really inconsistent AI. The Campaign AI on Moderate can be either super easy or *brutally* difficult, and the trend applied to Skirmish maps too. For example, I played one match where the AI boomed and built a huge ~200 pop army with seemingly infinite resources, and it sent that army at me in one giant swarm, a constant barrage of units... and every game since then it never built more than 40 villagers, never boomed.

-one button to interact with everything makes the game frustrating after a while (random weapon swaping with monkeys during gathering).
-if there are more items on one tile. welll... though luck, you need to pick it all up (also move the monkey standing there)

The Survivalists,"so far, the only game I wish I could refund, it's pretty fun at first since you know nothing and are exited to explore, find resources and build a house, eventually it's just a grind, you're just there walking 5 kilometres to the nearest dense forest for wood since the other forest has been cut down and there's no way to replant it

The combat is decent, eventually worthless after you amass an army of murder monkeys which btw is boring as hell to get, just find temple, kill tribe men or whatever, do emote, kill more, free monkey, good job, you progressed, it's honestly wasted potential, if the game had an actually worthwhile progression system and an actual fun way to collect monkeys, maybe with denser and more randomised dungeons with them as rewards rather than just two rooms, it could be cool

Honestly, it's a 4/10, the potential is there, but it isn't played upon, it feels like the game was made to fill a quota or something, I really dislike it, by the price of it, you might as well spare extra cash and buy Minecraft which has mods, lots of consistent updates and... come on it's Minecraft, no introduction needed

Is it fun with friends? idk, I'm not willing to waste someone else's money just to get bored anyhoo",False,Strategy
The Survivalists,"This would be a great survival game with a lot of great elements, but unfortunately some poor design choices and bugs prevent the player to get immersed.

At first the fact that every action can be done with only one key, (space) looks like a great approach, but given that -everything- is perfomed by that, very often unwanted actions occur/trigger, which is very annoying.
You should forget about this and use a proper key assignment layout like other decent games.

Also the item handling, splitting, etc. is very different from the already widely established scheme based on common sense.
On its own it would not be an issue. If it would work fine. But it is messy and don't have much logic.

In the mazes, the camera movement is quite unfortunate as the snapping or stationary camera is not a good idea when all of the other parts of the game use a camera fixed on the player.
As the camera stops on the border of rooms and only snaps to the next room when the player enters, it cannot be seen exactly what is on the other side of the door, even when open. So a situation when a player enters another room in the face of an enemy without seeing it, can happen and get attacked.
Which is silly.

Quite often we had desyncs and players dropped, which is also very annoying.
The last drop was when in a maze all of our progress got lost due to a disconnection/desync error.

Due to these and if a game produces this many bugs and is this unstable, then at least a usual rotating autosave feature would be nice, so users would have a way to restore the lost content and time.

I guess no devs will read this or will not give a damn anyway, but if you want to improve your game, then here you go.

The Survivalists,"A entertaining and addictive action/survival game. Also very chill; don't expect hardcore immersive gameplay here. Enemies aren't big threats and they won't chase you too far.
It's mostly a traditional survival experience but with a twist: there's a bunch of monkeys to give you a helping hand. You can automate various tasks by teaching them how to perform anything. It's definitely not an idle game  though, you still have to supervise what they, provide tools or do some micromanagement. It's also nothing like Satisfactory or Forager. I thoroughly enjoyed managing a simian team and exploring the open world map. Great pixel art and great soundtrack too. 
 
Something i  liked is how everything is nicely balanced, even for single player. I rarely had to farm, and even if you gotta do it, it's not a long tough chore. The monkeys NPCs really mitigate the usual grind of the Survival genre. Also: i was never stuck when it comes to progression.

A few things bothered me though:

-You can't tell monkeys which precise crop to plant, so they will basically plant any seed they came across. You can't remove early sprouts, so you either wait for harvest or destroy/rebuild your field.

-Raids are often a confusing mess. Some enemies will spawn within your base, making your defenses useless. 

-Monkeys AI can occasionally bug. 

-Affliction status didn't seem to work, i'm not sure if that was a bug, and i'm not sure if i'm mad about it

-I liked exploring dungeons but they're not that interesting: just clear one room after another for 10-15 minutes then spam the final boss to death. 

-Many sidequests weren't incredible at all (like kill 4 wolves, build 25 walls you don't need etc...)

-It's repetitive, i wish there was more content.

-Very light difficulty for the most part

Despite those complaints, The Survivalists is still a solid game for both solo and mulitplayer.

Battlefield 4™,"Battlefield 4 is the kind of game that makes you feel like a badass one minute and like you’re just part of an explosive accident the next. Seriously, one second you’re sniping across the map, racking up kills, and the next, you’re accidentally running straight into a tank—talk about a bad day at work. It’s not just about killing the enemy, though (though that’s definitely a big part of it). You’ll also have to master flying helicopters, driving tanks, and navigating through buildings that can be leveled by artillery, all while your squad yells at you to “revive me!” The level of chaos is real, and sometimes, it feels like you’re in the middle of a Michael Bay movie… except with more random explosions, less logic, and a lot more chaos. But hey, if you’re into feeling like you’re a part of an action-packed war movie, then Battlefield 4 is the perfect ride.

Battlefield 4 is a large-scale, first-person shooter that emphasizes teamwork, strategic combat, and epic battles across vast maps. With an impressive selection of vehicles like tanks, helicopters, boats, and jets, you’ll be able to pick your poison when it comes to how you want to dominate the battlefield. The game features a dynamic destruction system that allows you to blow up everything from walls to entire buildings, adding a layer of strategy as you can obliterate cover and force enemies out of hiding. The core of the gameplay revolves around the four classes—Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon—each offering a unique set of abilities and tools that contribute to the overall success of your team. Whether you’re dropping ammo for teammates, providing long-range sniper support, or repairing a tank in the middle of a firefight, there’s always something for everyone to do. The maps are huge and diverse, offering urban warfare, open deserts, and tropical jungles, ensuring that no two rounds ever feel quite the same. It’s chaotic, intense, and incredibly satisfying when everything clicks.

What truly sets Battlefield 4 apart from other shooters is its combination of epic scale, tactical gameplay, and unpredictable, all-out warfare. The destruction mechanic isn’t just a flashy gimmick—it’s a game-changer. Whether you’re planning a tactical assault or just going for broke, the way the environment can change in real time forces you to constantly adapt your strategy. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing an entire skyscraper collapse as you make your escape from an enemy squad, or the heart-racing moments when you’re piloting a jet through the sky, narrowly avoiding missiles from an enemy helicopter. The game has aged like a fine wine, offering a well-rounded mix of intense infantry combat, vehicle warfare, and strategic objectives. If you’re a fan of large-scale combat, teamwork, and a shooter that rewards both skill and strategy, Battlefield 4 is definitely worth your time. Whether you’re a newcomer to the series or a seasoned vet, the game has something to offer for everyone—and yes, you’ll still get plenty of opportunities to blow stuff up.",True,Strategy

Engine, graphics, sounds, animations, gunplay - topnotch as in every BF. Even as a dated game this is still very good and should also run on older hardware with very high fps (120+).
Levolution (destruction of environment) is amazing and its a mystery to me why newer games dont use this as much or expand on it.
 
Negatives about graphics - some scenes are WAY to dark, but when u crank ur brightness up theres as many scenes than that are way to bright.
Amateurish enough - this is still a thing 12 years later in BF 2042 - not as often but still (2042 Caspian Border buildings).
Aprox every 4th serverjoin the game just freezes and refuse to do anything - alt-f4 and rejoin than it works - EA quality as always.

Gameplay wise here as infantry you are just cannonfodder for the vehicles. Balance is HEAVILY leaned towards vehicle play.
If you dont get one - you die and cant do shit.
Ofc planes and choppers are OP asf here - also still a thing in Bf2042. Really weird that one since they nailed the balance in Bf1.
Additionaly unlocking is a MAJOR pain in the ass.
And you have to unlock EVERYTHING. Even with the help of battlepacks that you get alot now right at start.
You will die alot without any chance because you are a beginner and dont know shit but because also your euqipment just SUX big time.
Most other players have played this for years now and will just wipe the floor with you.
And ofc theres movement glitches/exploits that the pros use all day long. Ofc not fixed by DICE, nope.
So all in all. If u want the good ol Infantry only Metro madness from BF3 - you can have that here, theres plenty of maps and modes that provide that.
But the major thing here is vehicle play with inf as cannonfodder. 
If thats ur thing this is best BF for it.

Singleplayer campaign - in the top ten of the worst ever ive played.
Theres no real gameplay here. Aim at red triangles thats it.
Everything is fake. Ofc theres the typical murican we-are-the-good-guys-army-bs. Lots of empty blablablub and screaming and overdramatic music. 
Explosions every second. Lots of bloom, lensflare, shiny surfaces and over the top contrast scenes, probably to hide all the ugly sides of the graphics.
Theres constantly something bright in ur face that blinds u - ALWAYS. Annoying asf. 
Whoever designed the achievemnts for this should be forced to play this until the end of his stupid life, because u have to replay this multiple times if u want everything done, and when playing this just ONE time is already a fcking chore... well...  asshole achievement design at its finest.",True,Strategy

""A warzone plagued with glitches, lag, and endless frustration.""

Battlefield 4 had the potential to be an incredible shooter, but even years later, it’s still riddled with issues that make it a struggle to enjoy.

Netcode & Hit Registration – Expect to die behind cover, trade kills constantly, or empty an entire magazine into an enemy just for them to turn around and one-shot you. The lag compensation is a disaster.

Buggy & Inconsistent Gameplay – Rubberbanding, random crashes, and vehicles that sometimes handle like they have a mind of their own.

Ghost Chopper in Shanghai – A helicopter that appears out of nowhere, only to vanish just as quickly.
Ghost People Disappearing into Thin Air – Enemies and even teammates sometimes blink out of existence right in front of your eyes.

Unsyced Audio & Broken Rendering – The game often fails to load visuals properly, making it look like an unfinished pre-production build.

Infinite Loop Jump on the Invisible USS Titan – Either you’re stuck in an endless jumping animation, or you fall into the abyss.

Swimming Inside the Titan Bug – The most infuriating experience. I had to spend 20 minutes holding W just to progress.

DirectX 11 Rendering Problems – DX11 makes the game a buggy mess, though switching to Mantle improves things slightly.

Infinite Black Screen Loading Bug – Because waiting forever to play is part of the experience.

That being said, BF4’s gameplay is better than BF3, but the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, and technical problems make it a frustrating experience.

Through all this suffering, I finally completed the campaign—a game I started but never finished a decade ago. And for that, at least, it was worth it.

Battlefield 4™,"really good grafics for a 2013 game, but i think the campaing is a bit to short in comparison to the battlefield bad company 2 and battlefield 3, but it still a goty.",True,Strategy
Battlefield 4™,"Bought the game with high hopes of it being a great story mode game. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is probably the biggest disappointment I've ever had regarding a story mode game. 

The game is filled with glitches and bugs, sometimes even so game breaking that you have to restart the mission and read forums on how to fix it. Visual bugs, where characters disappear on the corner of your screen, sometimes you fall through the floor and on the 3rd mission you have to swim underwater... except your character can't swim.

The story itself on a larger scale is a pretty cool concept - China and US all out war. But how it gets presented through the eyes of the main protagonist is lame, repetitive and overall boring. They try so hard to make you feel attached to your squad mates, but it feels so bland, unreasonable, rushed and emotionless that none of their deaths actually matter and to you, the player they were nobodies.

Gameplay is just attrocious. I played on normal difficulty and the game is stupidly easy. In fact the hardest part of it is to navigate through the cluttered map with linear, stupid tasks you have to do. This is one of those games in which you're the main character and you have to do EVERYTHING. From opening all of the doors and hatches to killing literally every single enemy to progress through the mission. The hitboxes suck, the maps rarely offer you comfortable cover, the enemy units are dumb as rocks and hide on the farthest corners of the map(you have to find them and kill them to finish the sequence). Oh and the story is about you and your squad right? Yeah, well your squad ain't doing shit. They're essentially non-existent as none of their bullets deal damage, they don't even distract the enemy and they can't die - what's the point of them?

Graphics are.. alright? Considering the age of the game, it looks good. My only complaints would be the visual bugs like random floating flames, ships and helicopters not having any indication of them firing(but you die anyway, it looks like telekenisis), sometimes weapons and units warp through each other, etc.

One more thing, the game required Origin to launch. :)

Overall, the game has an awful first impression on my try of Battlefield games. I do not recommend it on PC.",False,Strategy

Now it's February. I'm still here. Still playing. And for the first time in a while, I’m glad I stayed because I can’t stop playing this damn game.

10/10, life-changing experience. Would recommend.

If you haven’t played The Witcher 3 yet, do yourself a favor and try it. It’s not just a game. It’s an escape, a journey, a reason to keep going and I guess, sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.

Edit: I get that not everyone will understand, and that’s okay. But just because your experience was different doesn’t mean mine isn’t real. Not everyone processes things the same way. You had to face your struggles in your own way, and for me, this game was something that helped me hold on a little longer.

I don’t really talk about this because I’m afraid of being judged or told I’m just looking for attention. That’s exactly why I don’t reach out to people I know. Truth is, I wish I was just faking it. I wish this was just some cry for sympathy because that would mean I’m not actually struggling. But I’m not looking for sympathy. I don’t want people to feel sorry for me.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I never replayed The Witcher 3 after my first playthrough on GOG in 2015, where it was quickly cemented in my mind as among one of the greatest games ever made. The final DLC finishes off the story so beautifully, so completely, that despite absolutely loving the game it always just felt... wrong, to take our boy Geralt out of retirement for another go-round.

But now the wind's howling once again, and with the scent of the next instalment looming on the air, I knew it was time to dust off steel and silver and refresh myself on this landmark favourite.

Well, having just concluded the base game again around 10 years after that first playthrough, I can safely say this remains the case: The Witcher 3 is one-in-a-million, breathtaking in the scope of the incredible RPG experience on offer and astounding in the total consistency of its quality throughout.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? The music, the gameplay, the dialogue, the choice and consequence, the atmosphere, the exploration and worldbuilding... the quests that twist and turn, rarely predictable, always worthwhile... everything combines here to create such a compelling world to inhabit. Few games move so deftly between solving the day-to-day problems of the lowly folk to grand-scale, world-saving, empire-making-and-unmaking stakes.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has a great story, especially the part about Geralt trying to find his sworn daughter, Ciri. The characters are well-designed and memorable, and the dialogue feels a bit hard to understand and also funny at the same time. I definitely liked the multiple dialogue choice and having different outcome based on the dialogue u choose. Visually, the game is stunning, the graphics are great considering it as a very old game. 

Every game i play i am always addicted to its ost or music [ whatever you wish to say ]. This game definitely has some too good soundtrack. My fav one is "" Merchants Of Novigrad "". This one is soo good when it randomly starts playing when u roam around the city Novigrad. There is also one music i dont know the name but it starts playing when we play GWENT in DLC Blood and Wine. As we say GWENT i can say it is the most intresting cards game ive ever played in any in-game activity. It is hard at first but once you get the cards then it will be interesting. 

Although the combat style didn’t fully match my taste, I still found the game very enjoyable and engaging overall. Even if u dont like combat style or any other things related to game , the story will make you play this more and more. The DLC heart of stone is also very good, i liked the story of that dlc though the story felt like a side quest or just a quest , still it was great for me. Still playing the second dlc. 

It’s clear why The Witcher 3 is considered one of the best games in its genre.


Problems i faced:
I did face a lot of fps drop particulary in this game irrespective of the graphics quality. I can play GOT , Cyberpunk and other games with stable fps on medium preset or high and rarely faced fps drops but in Witcher 3 im still facing the issue and i dont like it all.

Horse riding experince is very bad atlest for me...my horse get stucks or mostly stops even when the is no obstacles and the horse often come in between fights with bandits or some random monsters i fight on streets, may be cause of fear level.

[i] (Note: This review is based on my playthrough from December/January 2024/25, with the next-gen update (patch 4.04) and both expansions installed.)[/i] 

[h2]Pros[/h2]

- The Witcher 3 features impeccable world-building and immersion. Many open-world games rely on generic, soulless content to fill their game worlds, but not TW3. From visual elements and countless documents you’ll stumble upon to every little quest you complete, everything contributes to this rich and colorful universe.


- Even 10 years after its release, TW3 is still an astonishingly beautiful game. The natural environments are breathtaking—from the swampy, foggy marshlands of Velen to the green forests and picturesque hills further north, the rocky, windswept isles of Skellige, and all the way to the awe-inspiring, Alps-like mountains surrounding Kaer Morhen. The same goes for major cities and locations, which are packed with details and diversity.


- The dialogues and characters in this game are written to near perfection. You’ll encounter dozens, if not hundreds, of memorable individuals, each with unique, multilayered personalities and agendas. You’ll love them, hate them, and, more often than not, feel sorry for them. Simply brilliant writing.


- The visual design of the characters in this game—both monsters and NPCs—is absolutely flawless, especially for a game of its age. I love all the gritty details and the unglamorous appearance of many NPCs, which makes the world feel more grounded and authentic. Even important characters are designed with noticeable ""flaws,"" adding to the game’s immersive, gritty atmosphere.


- Side quests offer a wide variety of unique stories, ranging from intriguing mysteries to moments of comic relief and everything in between. The quality of quest design is exceptionally high, with almost every quest enriching your overall experience through interesting characters, new locations, and immersive world-building lore.


-  The voice acting is phenomenal, truly bringing every character to life. Quite literally, everyone delivered a fantastic performance, and the casting couldn’t have been more perfect for nearly every role. From powerful emotional expressions to impeccable comedic timing, everything was executed to perfection.


- The soundtrack is otherworldly, perfectly blending Slavic folklore sounds and vocals with epic fantasy elements, resulting in unforgettable masterpieces you’ll find yourself listening to on YouTube years after completing the game.


- I love that the game features a glossary system where you can access all the books and documents you’ve previously read, along with entries on important characters and a special section detailing the monsters and bosses you’ve defeated. It provides both immersion through rich lore details and gameplay support with advice on how to overcome these foes.


- I know the game’s combat is a somewhat controversial aspect, but for me, while relatively simple and basic, it’s still fun and engaging—and at the end of the day, that’s what matters most. If you enjoy straightforward systems, you’ll likely find the combat satisfying.


[h2]Cons:[/h2]

[i] (Note: Keep in mind that this is a game developed in the early 2010s and released in the first half of 2015, so some of the issues I mention might not seem as significant for a game that began development nearly 15 years ago.)[/i] 


- Even after countless patches, the game still has its fair share of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to a notable number of quest-related and game-breaking issues.


-  Geralt’s movement often feels sluggish, jerky, and unresponsive. I understand the intention behind adding feedback to his movement, but for me, it doesn’t quite feel right and can sometimes be rather frustrating.


- Interacting with the environment (using the E button) is unfathomably frustrating. It drives me mad trying to find the right angle for the interaction prompt to appear, and often, it feels borderline impossible. This becomes especially aggravating in tight situations where you have only a small window of opportunity to interact with something.


- You can’t jump during combat, which often leads to situations where you get stuck, can’t reach your target, or can’t move past even the smallest elevation. In general, when the game switches to combat mode, the previously mentioned issues—sluggish movement and interaction problems—become even more noticeable and exaggerated.


- Placing all those treasures in the waters around the Skellige Isles is the only poor world design choice in the game. It adds no real value or quality experience beyond providing extra resources and feels like lazy filler content added when the developers have run out of time or ideas. Unless you’re strapped for cash, don’t waste your time chasing all those question-mark treasures scattered across the ocean.


- Combat against flying creatures is not fun and can be rather annoying. Especially when fighting against a flock of flying monsters.


[h2]Things I would love to see improved in TW4:[/h2]

- I hope they improve the progression system in The Witcher 4. I like the general idea in TW3 of selecting which passives and abilities to activate by assigning them to a limited number of slots. Ideally, this should have encouraged me to experiment with different builds, but instead, I found myself barely spending points in the second half of the game, and only occasionally switching out a few slots.

- I hope there will be a system to better organize books and documents, which may be added to relevant quests and characters, make it easier to search through them, add locations where were they found, etc. It’s great to have them there, but some order and structure is needed.


- I hope The Witcher 4 offers a greater incentive to use non-Witcher gear. Despite the variety of other weapons and armor sets, I found myself exclusively switching between different Witcher sets and investing my resources only in upgrading them.

- I hope that there will be a bigger incentive in TW4 to use the non-witcher gear. Despite there being many other weapons and armor sets, I was only switching between different Witcher sets and spending my resources on upgrading them.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"[H3] A beautifully presented and well-acted RPG, which just didn’t grab my heart. [/H3]

Looking at my notes, you would think I adored The Witcher 3. The quest writing challenged my expectations at every turn, pulling unexpected twists while making logical sense. Every side-story is filled with ‘ah-ha’ moments, leading you down a path before flipping the script entirely. These tales are brought to live with superb voice-acting, with villagers carrying the gruff of a hard-lived life in their words. Characters move around in conversation - a minor touch, yet a laborious one which is seldom seen in full-size RPGS.

The visuals are fantastic too; foliage is dense with considerable draw distance, and each blade of grass casts an individual shadow which sways in the wind. Character models are sharp, and modern lighting methods such as raytracing are included in the next-gen update. I love the colour grading, which adjusts in accordance to the weather and sells the mood of the world.

Yet, I didn’t fall in love with The Witcher 3. The beautiful world is busy with optional content, but it’s just that: busy work. Killing wraiths and destroying monster dens might make for great podcast listening, but the lack of progression associated with these side tasks means the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze. Levelling is slow, which is tolerable, but rarely does it carry worthwhile new abilities. Upgrading your fire spell, Igni, for example, lets you spew a few more flames but that’s really it. The way you interact with your magic doesn’t change or offer any creative use.

And really, I didn’t feel The Witcher 3 encouraged any creativity at all. You’re roleplaying strictly as Geralt, and I would be hardpushed to say there are even ‘builds’. Conversations are mostly linear with few choices on offer, and (in effect) your charisma spell is rarely utilised. Movement feels stiff, and swimming feels like a constant fight against the controls. The game is also filled with glitches. Geralt shrunk down to 4’2 for a large portion of the game; quest characters refused to talk unless I restarted the game; textures would flicker; the game would freeze during loading, and it regularly switched to first-person.

I didn’t feel I could express much creativity within the game, and so it failed to resonate with me. The Witcher 3 is an improvement on its predecessor in nearly every way, and the story is genuinely well-written and even better acted, but I think I have to conclude that the series just isn’t for me.",True,Strategy
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is often considered one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Created by CD Projekt Red, the game presents a vast open world brimming with deep narratives, intricate characters, and significant decisions. The story, focusing on Geralt of Rivia’s mission to locate Ciri, is emotionally captivating and incredibly immersive.

A standout feature of the game is its world-building. The scenery is stunning, ranging from battle-scarred towns to thick woodlands and vibrant cities like Novigrad. The side quests are brilliantly designed, frequently incorporating moral dilemmas and surprising twists that render them equally significant as the primary narrative.

In terms of gameplay, The Witcher 3 integrates strategic combat, alchemy, and magic, enabling players to customize their fighting techniques. Moreover, the expansions (Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine) significantly enrich the experience with captivating missions.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"[h2] This game is everything and even more for me. [/h2]

Long time ago, like 7–8 years ago, I played The Witcher 3 for the first time on PS4. I already knew what The Witcher series is, knew what to expect. Remember spending more than a hundred hours in it, loving it. But I was a high schooler at the time, and think I just couldn't comprehend the whole beauty of this game and its world.

Now, so many years later, after getting inspired by [url=https://www.twitch.tv/elajjaz] Elajjaz [/url] streams of the first two Witcher games, I decided to re-play The Witcher 3 myself, and damn, what a good decision it was.

So, the last month and a half I was living and breathing Witcher, I was obsessed, I still am. I didn't expect to be so emotionally invested in it again, despite knowing/remembering story bits and such.

After so many years, the game still holds up gracefully. Yes, some aspects are clunky, like horse riding or fist fighting, there are occasional bugs, but everything else is just perfect. The game is beautiful, it sounds good, it feels good. With years, I started to appreciate art more, the amount of work people put into it, and how it affects us - gamers, readers, listeners. I wanted to literally bathe in The Witcher world and atmosphere.

Every aspect of this game is like a puzzle piece to me that fits perfectly with other pieces and completes the whole stunning picture. The visual design, models, locations, world building etc. are so good. Just walking through the streets of Novigrad or nature of Skellige Isles is an unforgettable experience. Soundtrack of this game is something else entirely - unique, varied, emotional, always accompanies your adventure, moments of peace, danger and sorrow. Every time I hear Priscilla's song and [url=https://youtu.be/8RIaIO9Fs64] cover of it in Ukrainian by Eileen [/url], I do my best not to shed a tear; every time I hear Kaer Morhen theme it feels like getting back home; every time I hear ""Yes, I Do..."" my heart trembles and I have a smile on my face.

And of course characters and their stories, that is what makes this game truly special. I love characters in The Witcher. They are so expressive, so interesting. You know that feeling when you just want to see your favorite characters and listen to their dialogs? Look at their interaction with each other and such? It's just incredible when you don't need action happening on screen, you don't need explicit scenes and such, you just want to sit there listening to stories of Ciri's adventures, play a round of Gwent with Zoltan, look in the eyes of your beloved Triss or Yen. Also, I really loved the English voice-acting, actors and actresses did an amazing job in bringing all the characters to life. In such moments, you understand how important well written characters are, because they are the ones that make us so emotionally attached to games like The Witcher. Did you see and/or remember that 10th anniversary of The Witcher series video with all the characters? Priceless.

I understand that my personal experience doesn't translate into everyone's else, we are all different, seek different things in games, perceive the world in our own way. I expect that, maybe, many people will disagree with me, but The Witcher 3 really is one of the greatest games of all time, I would recommend it to anyone without any hesitation. The sheer amount of emotions and feelings, amazing storytelling, characters, atmosphere this game has you won't find anywhere else. During such moments I am actually proud to be a human being, live alongside and witness all the art that other people create. And this game definitely is a work of art.

In the years since, the bugs have been quashed and technical limitations have been lifted with the advent of new generations of graphics cards, but too little too late.

For what its worth, I dropped probably 500 hours into the console version (PS5) of this game and an additional 80 something (starting a fresh run, going up) on computer because I love it that much.  If you like 3rd person sword play w/ light spell casting and a fun poison build up meter based on the ""witchers poisons"" you are using trying to not become a monster yourself.  Quests are VERY gray area and there is no right or wrong answer.  Sometimes you are going to do everything right and everyone is going to die.  That is just this games way of saying, ""what, you arent Rand Al'thor from 'The Wheel of Time' series (well the book series anyway) and you dont have near limitless power, you are Geralt of Rivia and crap doesnt always go your way and you cant control it.

Well, here we are almost 200 hours later lol. This game is fantastic and it gave me a sense of child-like wonder I haven’t had since BG3 and BoTW/ToTK. Everything that didn’t click with me as a child clicked with me now in a wonderful, compelling way.

Gameplay is fluid, exciting, and fun. Mixing and matching different mutations, skills, and equipment was rewarding; the story and characters were written superbly, only faltering in small pockets of my experience; the political aspect of the game was shockingly complex and a total blast to learn about and navigate in.

Also, it can’t be understated how genuinely breathtaking this game is at moments. The music composition and art direction created a completely unique identity for this game that left me entirely enraptured.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"One of the greatest RPGs ever made, and for good reason. The game offers an expansive open world, deep storytelling, and immersive gameplay that set a new standard for the genre.

Story & Characters
You step into the boots of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter navigating a world torn by war, political intrigue, and supernatural threats. The main story revolves around finding Ciri, Geralt’s adopted daughter, while avoiding the ominous Wild Hunt. However, what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its side quests—many of which feel as compelling as the main narrative. Choices matter, and the consequences are often unpredictable, leading to multiple possible endings.

The characters are equally memorable. From the fiery Yennefer to the charming yet tragic Triss, and the brooding yet lovable Dandelion, the cast is filled with depth. Even minor NPCs have well-written backstories, making the world feel alive.

Gameplay & Combat
Combat in The Witcher 3 is fluid, involving a mix of swordplay, magic (signs), and alchemy. While some may find the combat a bit clunky at first, mastering dodging, parrying, and potion usage makes encounters feel rewarding. Enemy variety is excellent, and the game encourages preparation—using the right oils, bombs, and tactics against different monsters.

Beyond combat, the game is filled with activities: exploring vast landscapes, playing Gwent (the in-game card game that became so popular it got a standalone version), crafting, and hunting monsters for contracts. The open world is one of the most detailed and immersive in gaming history, with stunning environments ranging from the war-torn lands of Velen to the bustling cities of Novigrad and the majestic Skellige Isles.

Graphics & Sound
Visually, The Witcher 3 remains stunning even years after release. The day-night cycle, weather effects, and character animations contribute to an incredibly immersive experience. The soundtrack is equally brilliant, featuring Slavic-inspired compositions that perfectly complement the game's dark fantasy setting.

Expansions
The DLCs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, are more than just add-ons—they are full-fledged expansions that offer some of the best content in the game. Blood and Wine even introduces an entirely new region, Toussaint, with its own storyline and improved mechanics.

Verdict
With a deeply engaging story, rich open-world exploration, and meaningful choices, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an RPG masterpiece. Whether you're a fan of narrative-driven games, action-packed combat, or simply exploring beautifully crafted worlds, this game is a must-play.

My only complain is that [spoiler]Io never survives ;-;[/spoiler]",True,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"I liked this game despite some of the design choices.

Boss fights were hit or miss. Some were epic and fun, but others were frustrating because it was hard to see where the bosses' moves would land. Some bosses might have been unnecessarily difficult for me because I didn’t bring a companion to the fights.

Soloing all bosses is definitely doable, though I don't think the game is designed to be played that way. Having a companion makes boss fights much easier, as they can revive you if you take too much damage. Most bosses can kill you in one shot if you don’t block or dodge their attacks.

The music was enjoyable and, at times, even quite epic.

The gameplay is reminiscent of Dark Souls 1 in its clunkiness. Compared to the more modern gameplay of Dark Souls 3 or Elden Ring, it’s definitely less refined, but still good enough in my opinion.

Visually, Code Vein offers environments that are both stunning and bleak, fitting well with the game’s theme. However, the beauty of these environments is somewhat diminished by a lack of variety within the same area.

Each location, while initially impressive, quickly becomes repetitive, offering little in terms of new scenery or unique elements as you progress. The level design primarily consists of corridor mazes, which can feel monotonous and detract from the overall exploration experience.

The story is probably the strongest aspect of the game, along with its characters. I found it genuinely enjoyable to follow the narrative and learn more about each character.

Overall, I think this game is good enough to be recommended to anyone who enjoys Souls-like games.",True,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Code Vein is a very cosy anime version of Dark Souls. It's one of the few proper souls-likes that have nearly the same mechanics, but more streamlined. It has bonefires, estus, currency dropped on death, respawning enemies, looping level design, stamina based combat, rolling, blocking, parries, equipment load mechanic and animation locks.

It builds upon what Dark Souls established by expanding and upgrading the mechanics. Weapon transformation makes sense unlike in DS1 and you can teleport between bonefires freely from the start. Code Vein also builds upon looping level design taking it to the next level. The infamous Cathedral of Sacred Blood is peak level design with an insane amount of loops and nonlinear multi level exploration.

When it comes to difficulty Code Vein is far on the ""easy"" part of the spectrum. Companions deal an insane amount of damage, can revive you and will even mark enemies or exploration points on map. Sure you can disable them, but the game was designed around having a companion so some fights (mainly the dual boss fight) will be extremely annoying without a companion.

Code Vein also features an amazing character creator which is honestly one of the best character creators out there. It gives so many customisation options that even Cyberpunk or Monster Hunter games feel limited in this aspect.

While amazing, Code Vein is not perfect. Memories are a boring way to tell the side stories. There are way too many cutscenes. I felt like 30% of the gameplay was just watching cutscenes. And lastly the worst part - The Depths. The Depths take everything Code Vein has and turn it into shit. Maps are repetitive and boring, you refight the same enemies and exploration is so linear you would think the design was outsourced to Ubisoft. And the worst thing about The Depths is that you cannot skip them if you want to see all the story and unlock all the skills.

Overall, Code Vein is a great game with some horrible ""optional"" content. It has the Dark Souls mechanics and atmosphere, but is way more approachable.",True,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Good Darksouls anime game.  Story is decent.  Problem is delivery. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have players walk slowly through memories with 10-20 seconds of downtime in between doesn't know gamers.

CODE VEIN,"Honestly, felt like I was playing a long demo. In terms of the gameplay, combat, mechanics, animations, a lot of, well, everything, was very unpolished, not fully fleshed out, not smooth, janky, wonky, clunky, the list goes on. Area designs aside from 3-4 places were cool, nothing to scream home about though. Boss designs/fights, some were mid to alright, others were actually pretty dope

The games whole concept/idea though was probably my favorite thing, in addition to having a great character customization, and the story, while it could've been told better, was nice. The NPCs were also cool, though sometimes the voice acting would feel a bit flat. Lastly, I actually really liked the memory sequences, just wished you weren't slow walking in them all the time

My final thought? Bandai, maybe it's best that you step away from the souls genre...

I'm at a part people say to spend 2+ hours grinding xp/currency to overcome, and I just don't know if I have the energy for that. There's no other areas to go to instead. I've got a boss in front of me and all the other content up to that boss is finished with another hour or so of grinding to do, so that I can level up and tank the harder to avoid hits. And...

CODE VEIN,"The game has the worst auto save system of ANY Souls Like, and on top of that it has some of the worst areas ever made for any kind of game. You just completed one of the most hated areas in the game without dying, got more than a million ""souls"" and went out to reload the area for an NPC sidequest because you don't want to respawn all of the 100+ endgame enemies you just killed while exploring? Well, fuck you! Because the game only auto saves when you rest on the ""bonfires"", so now you just lost 2 hours of progress in one of the most lazy, confusing and boring areas of the entire game.

Cathedral of Sacred Blood is a lazy, boring, confusing area that has no good rewards in the form of lore, design, items or quests for you, but it will consume more than an hour or two of your life because the map is made to be purposely confusing so it can add bloat and artificial content to the game. But HEY, you finished the map, so surely another one like that would not be present in the game right? Well, fuck you again, because there are two more maps like this, with the final one being bigger and more confusing.

While the combat has some cool abilities, the difficulty of the game is completely artificial, with ganks of 20+ enemies rushing at you through the entire map (those invasions are a main mechanic), backstab hitboxes that are completely bugged, attacks with animations that are almost instantaneous so you only know that an attack happened when you are on the ground with half+ of your health missing, enemies that are able to stagger you while armed with a wet noodle (imagine how great it is with 3 - 4 enemies attacking you at the same time) while you are not able to stagger then unless you use Gut's sword, bugged enemies that just flip through the map and cancel an entire event, forcing you to rest and restart the whole fight, etc.

Another beautiful thing, there is no out of the box exploration in this game's maps. On top of being incredibly lazy with the design, sometimes you find yourself in a map that has more vertical exploration and see that you can fall down on an area bellow to explore it. You go on, take the leap, and guess what, your character is instantly killed, without even starting the falling animation, because the devs want to force you to follow one path and one path only while exploring certain paths, something that goes against all that is used in other maps with ledges and vertical exploration.

The story is ok, the combat is acceptable considering the flashy abilities, and the aesthetic of the game is good, but god I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone to buy this game. This is coming from the guy that likes to plat every souls like game, no matter how great or shitty they are.",False,Strategy
CODE VEIN,"Cautious recommendation. 

There was a meme that referred to Code Vein as “anime Dark Souls” up to its’ release back in the day, and for better and worse that seems right on the money after my playthrough. Unfortunately, the combat in this game just feels a little “off” to me in a way that Dark Souls and Monster Hunter don’t. It’s also clear that they wanted to cater more to coop play than Dark Souls does, which is fine but does contribute to some additional unevenness in single player. For the most part the difficulty of the game doesn't get too out of hand, though it is clearly balanced around using an AI companion. The companions differ slightly in terms of fighting style, but differ even more in terms of effectiveness.

This game is definitely not for everyone especially given it’s occasional focus on T&A, but I had fun with the story and world (except the level design of the Anor Londo ripoff). [spoiler] RIP Oliver. [/spoiler]

The level design and enemy placement is abysmal making you almost always fighting 3+ enemies at the same time on top of the bad combat.

In that respect, the game did not disappoint. The game boasts a lot of customization, beautiful outfits, and lots of opportunities to pose for screenshots. With respect to everything else, I would not recommend playing this unless you love the Dark Souls type genre and have lots of time to kill.

Pros:
- Beautiful visual kei / goth inspired outfits
- Plenty of character customization options
- Music by VAMPS
- Lots of skills allowing for different play styles
- Vague dystopian story that is interesting when it makes sense
- Characters that are interesting enough

Cons:
- Ugly environments that blur together and get stale fast
- Maps that were designed by a sadist (the Cathedral begs for a cheat mod)
- Grindy and tedious gameplay (made worse by the fact you need to finish the game at least 3 times to get all 4 endings!)
- Limited guidance and direction leading to easily missable content (a walk-through is highly recommended)
- A story that can be nonsensical at times with a plot full of so many holes its Swiss cheese

CODE VEIN,"Easily one of the WORST Souls-like game I've ever played in my entire life. This game has some of the clunkiest and janky animations and INSANE clothing/armor clipping issues until its not even funny. This abomination of a game is truly a wonder to behold.

The Coop Ai partner is unfathomably useless 95% of the time, you can have all the aggro in the world and they'll just sit there and watch and do nothing. I've seen my Ai partner do 10 dodges in a row in a corner of a boss fight fighting his inner demons while the boss destroys me.

Mother of GOD it doesn't stop there, just when you think it can't get worse, ooh it absolutely does. The combat is atrocious and some of the WORST I've ever seen, there is no aggro/enmity system here. You CAN NOT GET AGGRO and its random but MOST of the time the enemy will just full on target you and completely ignore your useless lobotomized Ai partner.
The healing in this game is so small and substantial EVEN WITH HEALING BUFFS it feels like putting a hello-kitty bandaid on a severely broken skull fracture.

The screen shaking is also another huge problem in this game and some bosses where you NEED to lock on will just send you to the toilet after puking your brains out from how nauseating their movement is. The level design is absolutely abysmal every level feels the same, every level feels like you die by pitfall drops every level has some ungodly amount of something VERY ANNOYING that'll piss you off.

This game is fun. Its what I like to call a ""Souls-Lite"". Its not quite a proper souls like. It doesn't have big sprawling and complex dungeons, it doesn't have wide and varied enemies, it doesn't have a particular hard difficulty.

either way, real review... the environment around the world levels are gorgeous, even if you have the graphics on low. the city-scape is majestic as hell, and the underground is terrifying. but, this is a world where ruin escapades on all fours. animal-like. death around every corner. not for the weak

I could possibly put up with all of that, but the map design is second to none AWFUL for a souls-like game. The cathedral should be put on a pedestal for how to NEVER design a map. The rest of the maps were no better, designed more in the name of tedium than exploration/satisfaction.

However, if you're just looking for a gooner souls-like, then hell yeah get in there. Fantastic mod support to help make the game slightly more enjoyable, and it was with mods alone I tolerated this game to the end. For it to STILL have a $60 price tag is an absolute JOKE, however.",False,Strategy

If I had the power to reverse time, I would use it solely to stop myself before I even considered buying this unholy abomination absolute 𝒟𝑜𝑔𝓈𝒽𝒾𝓉 of a game. In fact, if given the choice between replaying Code Vein and dragging my balls through a field of magma-coated razor wires while being chased by a swarm of bees that each one of them got a personal saw, I’d happily accept my fate as a shredded human remain.

The combat feels like trying to fistfight a tornado while blindfolded, the AI is as useful as a wet paper bag in a hurricane.
Every boss fight felt like a personal attack, they weren't challenging, but they were so poorly designed that I started suspecting the developers made them specifically to ruin my day.

CODE VEIN,"This game is Bloodborne on easy difficulty in terms of its base game content, but don't let that fool you; Code Vein has its own unique mechanics and methods of dealing with its various enemies that can take veterans of Dark Souls out of their comfort zones at a moment's notice.

But it shares enough in common with the mainline Dark Souls series, and with Bloodborne that you'll find your way through after a some trial, error, and acceptance. The story is okay, I mostly checked it out to get a better idea of what was going on but it felt par for the course in terms of Anime geared towards older teens and young adults. It is a product of its time when it comes to character customization.

It does have a satisfying audio feedback and nice enough visuals to keep the mind stimulated, as well as enough skill combinations, weapon combinations, and endings to warrant multiple playthroughs for the sake of experimentation. And like the Soulsborne titles, you are given substantial control over its difficulty (you can play with an a.i. companion or you can play alone, you can play like a tank or adopt a more damage based play-style, go for full or partial completion etc.).

Only things I don't quite like are most of its boss designs (hitboxes are the biggest culprits, damage even more so), some of the level designs (if you know the biggest culprit, you know; it lives up to its reputation), those are its biggest issues to me.

Unfortunately, the community can be rough on newbies; I've been kicked from more lobbies than I can count just because I'm not high-level yet. But, if you score a good group or have friends to team up with, it's an experience you've got to try.

Now, I'm not one for completing all tasks or nailing that perfect investigation; I'm simply here for the fun of figuring out the ghost type whilst being hunted. Sadly, the majority of players seem to be after achievements etc. and therefore the key is to find players who vibe with your style, or you might find yourself booted out more often than not.

When I play this game solo, I almost lose my balls when I get jumpscared and killed by the ghost. Playing in groups makes the game feel less scary, but it can still be scary. The game gets even scarier when you play on nightmare and insanity which are the 2 hardest difficulties.

An Immersive and Terrifying Co-op Experience

Review Text:

    Phasmophobia is a thrilling co-op horror game where you and your friends investigate haunted locations. The atmosphere is genuinely creepy, and the unpredictable ghost behavior keeps every round exciting. Playing in VR adds another layer of immersion, making it even more terrifying. If you enjoy cooperative horror games, I highly recommend giving Phasmophobia a try!

At the beginning I was a bit scared and the investigations took longer, but now I'm hardened.

Phasmophobia,"When you play this game for the first time, it's really scary because the sounds are really well made. Everytime i heard a sound that is not natural, for example hissing or humming i immediately pressed Alt+F4. but I got used to it and only pressed it again when a hunt started. But i realized that the ghosts aren't that scary, they are pretty dumb and if you have incense then you are almost guaranteed to survive the hunt. Just ignite it and run into the ghost. The ghost will be blind and will not find you for a few seconds. The game is actually pretty easy, the trick is just to have enough incense and crucifixes. You will get used to it. Thank you for reading my opinion, good hunting!",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,It's such an addicting game and SO much fun trying to learn the different ghost types. Also just a great game to play with friends.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,I think I got this game closer to it's initial release and played it a hand full of times. I would only come back during Halloween to get that spook in for the year. This last event was garbage though but I've been playing it increasingly more and more since then. 150+ hours at the time of writing this and it's still awesome to play with friends. We're always down for solving mysteries and that's what we get out of going in and hunting ghosties. If you're dying a lot to start then start by going in and thinking of where you'll hide if its starts hunting. Slowly progress up in difficulties once you get familiar with ghost types. Learn some ghost behaviors that have nothing to do with the evidence you're collecting and that's when you'll start dying less and leveling up more. I have done some nightmare modes where we just could not figure out the second clue. The ghost randomly shut the front door and we saw all we needed to see and dipped. (ONLY the Yurei can interact with the front door without a ghost event happening) I think the game gets a little less scary once you face the fears a few times but there are games where I looped a ghost in the kitchen then jumped at a ghost scare that popped up right in front of me.,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"I solidly don't recommend this game. 
It's peak has past. 
Go to one of the other games that are adjacent. 

When this game launched it was fantastic developer that cared and appreciated their community. Updating bugs almost the moment the community noticed them and the community requests were always the next update. 

Since getting a team on board they have split from the communities wants of more experience content and focused solely on new cosmetics and further updates towards the loom of the game and less about the actual spook of the game. 
They have dropped sever road maps including the horror 2.0 that people have heavy requested and pushed it back and back in favour of other minor things people don't want. 

As someone who enjoyed this game to the point of speed running it with mates and streaming it prior, seeing the devs cutting off any suggestions and doing what they want with no consideration of what we as a community ask for, as they currently don't even take suggestion feedback is a serious issue and down right a slap in the face to us who used to love it. 

I personally believe the main initial developer has lost any will or drive to make things happen in this game and has moved on or is getting told what to do and how to do it by their team and by other equity owners since incorporation.",False,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"The games Connection problems make this game borderline unplayable. Even if you Incense before it hunts, still die 90% of the time because of the delays and bugs. I love this game concept, but being a PVE game, why not have it run on Client side. I feel like  its a simple fix to most of the issues. It adds more hackers to the game but again, being a PVE style game, people can just kick or them. Iv already found multiple cheaters anyway with it being server based so its not like its unhackable now. Just makes the game unplayable unless your in US or UK. Iv reinstalled 5 times, tried every fix I can by using VPN's and DNS changes. Checked and changed firewall settings. Great with friends, but thats it. Developers direction is interesting but its not for me given the lack of information any reporting for an early access game.",False,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"super duper fun game and very scary !!!!
when ghost runs around corner i go like 0:
just kidding ;)",True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,A strong co-op survival game that has continued to have loving care put into it for years. Looking forward to its future updates!,True,Strategy
Phasmophobia,"Still waiting for my prestige banner from before the rework.

Not a terrible game, but the direction it went depresses me. I feel like whenever titles like these hit that streamer sensation point developers start hearing ""Lose Yourself"" and bite off more than they can chew, hire a larger team before haphazardly reworking their game into something completely unrecognizable in the hopes of keeping around a crowd that was always going to leave to chase the next big thing. Logging in to see my progress wiped a second time on top of a seasonal event board sent me over. Why does a game like this need events?

The game's scare factor is strongest in its buildup, payoff is always variable. Hunts ultimately serve to the games detriment, the ghosts would be scariest if they were a constant but subtle threat killing players as a more unpredictable manner (still utilizing sanity). Hunts take that away by giving the game a clear ""YOU CAN DIE NOW"" sequence that kills all that tension that the game is so masterful at establishing and instead makes the game feel arcady. I understand why hunts exist from a progression standpoint (If players can lose their personal investment from dying you need gameplay to be somewhat predictable and to have a learning curve that can be mastered), but phasmophobia shouldn't be built from a progression first mindset.

Which is the problem in my eyes; the events, season map skins, constant equipment tweaking and balancing, and the clear focus on off-map progression makes the game feel like they are trying to develop a MP competitive grindfest like Dead by Daylight or Friday the 13th, and not a player focused HORROR game with no competitive mechanics. The game's focus should be on the moment to moment gameplay on a given map, not amassing resources to buy your next tier of equipment in the background.

Post rework (I'd say even as far back as when they added cursed items) this game lost its soul. The new asylum map in particular feels like something you'd see coming from a phasmophobia imitator and not from the OG itself in how over the top committed to horror tropes it is. The old asylum was a little bit much, but still gave the impression of having been a functional healthcare facility at one point. Beyond that it was fun to explore, like walking GM Krot. The new asylum would feel right at home in a Rob Zombie movie with how on the nose it is. My favorite level had always been the prison, because I believe this game's horror works best when in a clinical, lifelike, setting. I grew up watching ghost adventures and such, this game's original state felt perfectly suited to living out that larp. The current state of game, once again, reminds me more of games like Dead by Daylight where the developers intent of scaring you is completely secondary to the contained gameplay loop.

Anywho, I wish there was a neutral react. I gave it the blue thumb because I can bitch about the direction the game went all I want, it's 4 years old they haven't tried to milk me for any DLC. The primary loop is still fun enough, with enough of the old maps around that I can still play the game at its best, subtle.

The bar really is that low anymore. I swear it used to cost 14 bucks though, I wouldn't spend more than that on it but I could be misremembering.

At first I thought it was just a silly horror game to play with friends and was turned off from trying it, but then I started watching some of the various content creators play it on Twitch and saw just how much there is to this game! I am a huge investigation/mystery/sleuth game lover so that really is what this game sparks for me. The ""horror"" or scary ghost factor isn't what draws me to the game, and it honestly terrifies me at times, but as I am learning and growing used to how the various ghosts behave I am growing more brave!

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,"This game is truly a masterpiece!

The game does what it takes to force you learn and use the game mechanics to get good at it. It does not have a way to grind to make you extremely overpowered to overcome a challenge, so you either learn the game mechanics or you will get stuck until you learn.

The game uses the right way to make challenges difficult instead of just ""some enemy with more health and damage"". Every enemy has its own patterns of attacks and some are easier and some are more difficult.

Storywise, the game crafts an incredible story, lorebits in items and some sidequests that makes sense throughout the game. The game offers each of its main characters a well written design and made specially Isshin as one of my favorite characters.

You'll be Jumping,Parrying,Mikiri Countering, and attacking your whole game. Miazaki has done it again by re-inventing the wheel by adding a posture system, that allows you to instantly killing enemies (or removing one health bar from them if they have multiple) [b] if you break their posture[/b]. The game also has some stealth elements, where you can get an upper hand in a few combats by stealth, and not Fighting every enemy you see, or simply executing an enemy that didn't see you, or at least removing one of their lives.

Some enemies its better to break their posture by perfect parrying and doing actions that do a lot of posture damage(like mikiri counter) while some you have to burn through their HP.

And the main mechanic of this game that is on the name, you can revive once and sometimes twice in the same fight, while [spoiler] spreading scarlet rot to the NPC's making them sick [/spoiler]

Let's talk Asthetics and presentation: The game, visuals and asthetics are incredible, the sound design is slick, and the enemies are incredibly varied. And so are the bosses and mini-bosses. The soundtrack while very fitting for the game, i wouldn't really hear it outside of it.

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition," Despite my complaints, the one pro outweighs all of them, The game is great with the boss fights but, there is a lot of little things that drive me up the wall while playing it. 

Pros:
 - The game is at its best when you encounter a boss and are able to go back almost immediately after death. 

Cons:
 - Terror is a dumb game mechanic, Burn and Poison are fine but a status effect that just kills you is dumb. I am fine with some enemies that use it when it is telegraphed like the Monk, saying ""heads up there is a terror attack get out of the way"". However, there is no reasonable way to kill the Shichimen Warriors without Divine Confetti or the Purple Umbrella. Having to rely on a finite consumable for a game designed to be difficult, where you will need to do the fight more than once, is dumb. I do not want to stop fighting the boss to farm gold to purchase more divine confetti. Even with the umbrella, the fight is extremely boring. With other bosses it's a matter of staying out of their way for some moves but for the warrior, it is almost all the time. Hitting them once or twice and waiting for an extended period of time is boring. 

- Dragonrot, the loss of experience, loss of gold after death is a dumb mechanic. Not that it is punishing or harmful, it is just pointless. If I really needed gold or experience, i could just farm it. There is no real reason to cure dragonrot unless I wanted to do a side quest for fun, but it does not effect the game that much at all. 

- The Camera is awful.  There are enough times to be annoying where I'm near a wall or a big enemy and the camera just decides to freak out and stop locking onto the target. 

- Some mini-bosses have enemies around them that require you to kill them every time you respawn. I would have preferred it if they died only once because it is not difficult to kill them, it just takes up time when I just want to fight the main boss. 

 - At times the game is not good with telling you where to go. I must have the worst sense of direction because there were many times I had to look up a guide just to find out where to go next. 

 - The ""true"" ending  requirements are so incredibly convoluted, there is no reasonable way to find out how to get it without a guide.",True,Strategy

I havnt played any FromSoftware games before and initially thought Sekiro would be another simple fighting game with minimal story and repetitive fights that quickly gets boring. I am happy I was wrong! 
The games combat mechanics are brilliant. Instead of overwhelming players with a complex control scheme, Sekiro keeps the number of buttons and actions relatively low. However, mastering the combat requires precise timing and keenly observing the enemy to anticipate and execute a counter, making every fight a challenging that feels rewarding. I would say the fighting mechanic is [b]easy to grasp but a challenge to master[/b].

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,"This feels weird but, I recommend everyone to try this game but can't really recommend actually finishing it.
Let's set the record straight here, the game has a lot of good things going for it, but there is definitely a reason why they made Elden ring so different from this game and other games before that, that is one of the reason why I dropped it after few hours, which weren't really the thing for any other FromSoft game. 
Let's go piece by piece, story is good, music is top notch, graphics are too, optimization is actually present and gameplay is good. For me the problem is with the new approach to gameplay, developers give you so many tools to use, much more than any other game from the studio but the problem is that they are not really optional anymore. In Souls games and in Elden Ring tools were kind of difficulty sliders of a sort, you can find a specific use for them and make the specific aspect of the game easier but here....it a necessity not an option. There are multiple types of enemies that require you to use specific tool/prosthetic and whether you like it or not you will have to find combination that works for specific enemies and not just ones that you like to use. And while it grants you a lot of flexibility, you no longer have a leveling system or any other equipment that is more straightforward in it's use, there are no builds to try. Summing it up, in a lot of cases the difficulty of the boss lies in the fact whether or not you found a correct tool/prosthetic combo, not so much your personal skill or your build. 
And here lies another problem, map is very funky. You have no specific road to follow, which makes finding equipment all the more challenging, added verticality and necessity to go for stealth (because mobs are genueinly more pain in the ass than most of bosses) makes navigation even more confusing. So searching for the secrets/bosses will lead you to...demise in most cases, whether you will fall into abyss while trying to reach for specific item or will mess up with stealth, which by the way sucks...and this one is objective, it's badly made, sometimes you can walk up in front of an enemy and he won't notice but in most cases enemies will see you from other side of the map when you crouch in the grass.
 Next aspect is reward/punishment. The game punishes you for death much more than any other Souls game, gameplay and storywise, which in turn goes back to combat. You are forced to play the game certain way, which for me doesn't make any sense, as it genuinely takes away from me trying different stuff on my own volition. This combination creates a gameplay loop of trying stuff, dying in process, suffering consequences and trying different stuff untill you find what works. That is all too gimicky for me, but that is subjective so decide for yourself, it's just a shame there is no demo for the game.
Oh...and hitboxes on grab attacks absolutely suck.....

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Its a fun and easy game for people who like to stand on metal railing and then drop onto their balls five times in a row every time they die. 10/10,True,Strategy
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,"It's been argued whether Sekiro is a Souls-like, a rhythm game, or something completely in between, but regardless, at the end of the day, none of that really matters because whatever it is, there's a reason it won game of the year in 2019, it's unbelievably good.

Visuals
The game is visually stunning. Whether you're travelling the war-torn lands of Ashina, scaling Fountain Head Palace, or navigating the Poison Pools of the Depths, Sekiro constantly delivers breathtaking and immersive environments. Whilst the overall colour palette often appears bleak and muted, the splashes of colour that emerge from an emerging sakura tree, a distant fire caught at the corner of your eyes, or the blue glow of the Sculptor's Idols that dot about the map stand out in contrast.

Whilst the game doesn't reach the heights of cutting-edge visuals you'd expect from games such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Ghost of Tsushima, even in 2025, Sekiro still holds its own and looks great.

Sound
The soundtrack, ambience, and sound design are top-tier. The fast-paced, dramatic orchestral scores that accompany the game's intense boss fights are unforgettable, whereas the eerie, atmospheric tracks in areas such as Mibu Village or the Dungeon perfectly capture the more unsettling aspects of the world. Some tracks, such as Emma, the Gentle Blade and Divine Dragon, are so good in fact, that i still listen to them outside of the game on occasion.

The clashing of steel, sounds of deflections, and the battle cries of enemies are more than just immersive, they're also an integral part of gameplay, acting as audio cues that help players to react to incoming attacks. As for the voice acting, I played in Japanese, so i can't fully judge the quality of the performance, but from what i heard, everything sounded authentic and fitting to the tone of the game.

Story and Characters
As expected from a FromSoft game, the story of Sekiro is relatively cryptic, though it is slightly more digestible than what you'd get in a Dark Souls game. Simply playing through the game gives you a solid grasp of the narrative, but the deeper lore, like any FromSoft game, is found in item descriptions, environmental storytelling, and hidden dialogue. This approach works in the games favour, in my opinion, as it rewards those whom wish to dive deeper into the lore, without forcing exposition on those who just want to play a challenging game.

The game's protagonist, Wolf, is a quiet, sombre, blunt and gruff individual, yet despite this, he still stands out as compelling and sympathetic, this is especially represented in his devotion to Kuro, a supporting character. The supporting cast, from the game's bosses to the NPCs you'll meet along the way, are well-written and memorable, adding further depth to the world.

Gameplay
Saying that Sekiro plays like a traditional Souls game just because it's made by FromSoftware is a mistake, but for the most part, it doesn't. Whilst it shares many familiar elements, such as the punishing difficulty, precision combat, and need to learn enemy movesets, the core of Sekiro is built around deflecting, countering and mastering the flow of combat. Unlike Souls games, in which rolling and dodging are key survival tools, Sekiro encourages the player to stand their ground and meet their enemies head on, and break their posture before they break yours. Whilst this is something that might sound familiar on paper, it's something you'll only truly understand once you've played the game.

Stealth is another factor in the game, and whilst it isn't mandatory, it adds another layer of strategy for those whom want to engage in a more shinobi-centric approach to gameplay, and wish to take out enemies methodically, rather than charging straight in.

Unlike Dark Souls, Sekiro feels more focused and linear. There are fewer bosses, fewer collectables, and a more straightforward approach to exploration. But rather than this feeling limiting, the tighter structure allows the game to flow smoothly without unnecessary bloat.

Performance
Regarding performance, Sekiro, for me, was flawless. On my RTX 4070, i5-14600KF, and 32GB RAM system, the game ran at a locked 60 FPS on max settings, and in all the time i spent playing, i never saw it dip below once. There's noting really more to say, the game runs flawlessly.

Final Thoughts
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece in game design. It's fast, brutal, rewarding and it feels different from other games of the genre. Whilst it lacks the RPG depth found in Dark Souls or Elden Ring, it's sharp, precision combat makes it one of the most satisfying action games ever made.

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,"I pretty much only vibe with souls games, and even after dark souls and elden ring, this one is still my favourite. The limited weapon choice makes for extremely tight combat, making defence offensive makes it sand out from dark souls where you are now encouraged to be aggressive and get in the fight vs avoiding combos and waiting for an opening, and there is still good variety between skills and prosthetic arts to keep it from getting boring. 

Mostly though, improving is the most satisfying with this game. Bosses that took 20-50 tries the first time around are all do-able in under 5 tries 2nd playthough. When the combat clicks, it *clicks*, and nothing is as satisfying as the *ping* *ping* of deflecting perfectly.

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,"When I first started playing this game on my friends recommendation, I couldn't get past the blazing bull, so I quit and wrote it off as not for me. For some reason, I decided to pick it back up about half a year later. Then I got stuck at Genichiro. But with my friends watching in the discord call, I couldn't give up in front of them because that would just be embarrassing. After hundreds of deaths and probably 4 hours, the combat clicked, and I killed him. That's when I knew this was a good game.

After that I was free to appreciate every detail all of these artists put into this. So many beautiful rotten locations, so much terror, so much artistry in the bosses. After Genichiro I knew I could take whatever this game threw at me and overcome it. Beating a boss wasn't just worth it for the adrenaline and the pride though, but for the story as well. This world is far too fascinating for it to just have one game. The final boss is definitely one of the most brutal things I've had to do in a videogame, and it was all worth it, and I bet I'll fight them 20 more times. What a special game. It's not objectively perfect, but no other game has been able to do what Sekiro can. 

After finishing it once, I thought it was one of the best games ever made.

Valheim,"A solid survival game experience that's somewhat marred by grinding tedium and deaths that are too punishing at times.

For a game this small it's impressive how atmospheric and good looking it can be, showing that more polygons doesn't automatically mean a prettier game.  Whether it's a raging storm with rolling surf and rising water, an eerie quiet foggy day or just a beautiful sunset, it's pretty easy to get lost in the atmosphere of this game, especially when you're snuggled up indoors cooking roast deer over a hearth whilst rain pelts down outside.

The game progression tied to boss encounters gives you the carrot on a stick to keep moving forward which is certainly challenging at times, but gives you a reason to grind out gear levels to get stronger.

That said, grinding out said gear doesn't automatically equate to success and the inevitable corpse run back to claim your loot whilst also getting a skill drain punishment feels like a tedious gameplay mechanic that doesn't really encourage risk taking or exploration.  After having to do this a few times, you'll likely start looking up YouTube boss strategies to cheese the encounters as the bosses (whilst looking impressive) are all the usual bullet sponges that are 'weak to X weapon' which is often boring and cliche.

Whilst some people thrive on the machonistic challenge of these sorts of mechanics and chase that 'win against the odds' a-la-Dark Souls, the rest of us just want to build pretty castles and go fishing.  It's a tough world being a viking and Valheim will certainly put your skill and patience to the test, but the rewards are there if you can stick with it.

Make no mistake, this game is a brutal survival game experience.  It's punishing and often times frustrating, but has gameplay hook that makes it hard to just not give it one more go.  The world presentation is great, the atmosphere excellent and the general 'vibe' of the viking experience is captured well.

I have a few hundred hours logged on Valheim on Xbox (Series X) and now play on PC.  The game plays well on both systems, but of course if you have a good PC you can really take this game to the next level on presentation and performance.  Whether you're a controller or KBM player, this game has you covered and it even plays well on Steam Deck (which I have).  One of the benefits of such a small game install that punches above it's weight.

This is certainly a good game in the genre and hits many notes to make this one an easy recommendation (especially on sale), just be ready for the inevitable progression roadblocks and tedious grinding mechanics which can be make or break for you depending on your preferred playstyle.  Valheim is a test of endurance as much as it is skill with some encounters making you feel like you were unfairly treated, but you'll be hard pressed not to want to grit the teeth and give it one more go.

Valheim,"If you bought this game to play with friends, trust me, try to play it by yourself for a little while. At least get past the first boss solo. You'll get addicted",True,Strategy
Valheim,"For me this is the most eminently playable of the 'Open World Survival Craft' games, particularly solo or with friends, owing to well-balanced mechanics that include every part of the game world into systems worth continuously interacting with, even during long or advanced play sessions. The retro aesthetic and freeform procgen fully modifiable game world draw comparisons to minecraft, but with decidedly more progressive, biome-based gameplay, creating a more hardcore and drawn out experience.

The creativity the game does give you, mostly to do with building, farming and shaping the terrain, is more than enough to flex your artistic side while still keeping your attention on gameplay and survival. The warmth, weather and comfort systems are just enough to encourage innovative and convenient structures that are fully functional.

The food and hunting/farming systems are likewise enough to make extra effort worth it, but never completely necessary. The game has a remarkable ability to avoid tedium while still necessitating constant effort and attention to its varied mechanics. The very real threat of death and progression loss makes the safety of early biomes and resources relevant even in the late game.

If you like building forts in a wilderness that never fully gives in, while raiding enemies and dungeons and leveling up and crafting your character to perfection, this is for you. There is always something to do and it never feels boring.

Valheim,"I really like the core concept of this game and its gameplay mechanics, it’s a verry fun game to play with my friends. The combat is very simple but tense, the resource gathering is engaging and the base building (though a bit finnicky) is relaxing. It, however, is filled with many little inconveniences that add up to making the game a frustrating time sink. And I feel like the crux of the issue must be with how the game deals with death.

When you die, you lose your equipment. You will have to run back to collect it, this is not so bad early game where you can take a hit and everything is close by. But later in the game many of the enemies will one shot you, or the environment will kill you (such as the cold in the mountains). You will have to make use of food or potions to recollect your stuff. But if you die whilst getting your stuff or shortly thereafter you will have to use another set of potions and food buffs, because those are also lost on death. This would not be so bad if farming was not so intentionally obnoxious, for pretty much every major food item in the game you need something that is not easily renewable, such as berries from bushes that are not replant able and only respawn after 300 minutes or mushrooms that only respawn at the same place in one type of biome after 240 minutes and are therefore also not replant able. 

and if you somehow die in a late game area whilst under geared, and there is no portal nearby because you felt like exploring a bit at first. Guess what, you can say goodbye to your hard-earned gear. That gear that took you many hours to get and upgrade and is therefore not easily replaceable. And to top it all off, every time you die, you lose a LOT of your skill levels. So you end up losing even more hours of time through that as well.

And you will be dying a LOT in this game, because every time you move in to a new biome your current gear becomes obsolete. You will die to leaches poison, you will die to wolfs stun locking you to death, you will die to death mosquitos. All whilst you are struggling to spend hours grinding for that next set of armor and weapons, only to find out that the boss you will have to go up against is resistant to your weapons damage type. Or almost all damage types available to you if you are up against bone mass who is only weak to blunt or a damage type not available to you yet. So you have to back and to the mines and make new gear again.

all this combined makes for a farming game where you can not farm the things you need, a resource game where the resources you have gathered lose relevance the moment you move to the next area, and an exploration game that does not want you to explore because you will lose everything if you do.  It feels like a game that does not just want you to spend time on the game, it wants you to waste it.

Valheim,"Great game in general, enjoyed most of the game however a few negative aspects build up and climax in the final biome :)

 However the content loop is very linear for the most part and can get dry:
Farm/loot - New gear/Food - boss - repeat
Bosses have been too easy, completing the biome in general and getting to the boss fight is much more challenging than the boss itself. (plains is a joke)

The Tether range is complete bullshit and needs to be revised, enemies will chase you until they die from natural causes.

Missing Basic Quality of life - Craft from chest, SEARCH FUNCTION for menus?!?!?

Final Biome is straight up not fun to play. Huge hoards of enemies that you are not prepared for when you first arrive, and once you die once... enjoy 500 enemies chasing you all the way to your tombstone, joining the hoard that already killed you and then making the army of things defending you body even bigger!!!!!!!!

Valheim,"I just realized I've never left a review on this game.

My first ever PC game was Minecraft, and when I was younger I loved that game. Now a days, I can't get behind it. Something about playing the game as it was intended just doesn't tickle my fancy anymore, and I've never liked the mini-game servers in the first place.

Valhiem brings me back that joy of playing Minecraft. I've yet to finish the game, and am still discovering things, but I have completed at least over half of its progression. And yet, I still find myself coming back and enjoying it. I'm probably why our worlds take so long because I spend my time building while my friends wanna rush the next boss. I enjoy the difficulty of the game where it's super easy to get into, but it has a learning curve and if you wanna survive, you need to start getting better and start understanding how everything works.

The only thing I will say is that the game isn't very fun when alone. I feel like a big factor of this game is its building mechanics (which also have a learning curve) and when you can't show off your builds, it's alittle more lame. That and it's fun to goof off with your buddies. I'm sure some people will enjoy the game by themselves, but for me it's once again like Minecraft, I just can't enjoy it by myself.",True,Strategy

At the beginning we had 4 full time players with a couple that would join, and we ended with me and only a friend finishing it. So Iron Gate, please make Valheim great again. p.s. give the trader an item that lets you recall your spear when you throw it plz :)",True,Strategy
Valheim,"Now, don't get me wrong: I'm not here to throw shit at a good game, but I've reached the ashlands so let's start:

What the game does well:
- Offers a pretty good and immersive survival theme;
- A really nice exploration, with pretty stunning visuals (if your machine can render it) inspired by norse mithology;
- A good taming and breeding mechanic (although some little changes could be applied here and there);
- Nice boats;
- A nice construction mechanic (although so much stuff can't be accessed, even a lot of nice pieces already existing in game);
- Some nice pieces of equipment;

What is missing/could be improved:

- The combat system:
  Right now, the character is locked on the Y axis, meaning that you can't hit enemies unless they're directly in front of you, 
  as soon as they're positioned slightly up or down on Y axis compared to 
  you, they become impossible to hit... which would not be a problem if: 
  - the terrain wasn't mostly uneven, meaning it's hard to find a good plain field (especially in later biomes) that allows you 
    to fight back;
  - The enemies aren't Y plane locked... meaning they can hit you while you can't hit them back;
  - The enemies attacks have weird hit boxes, making them hit you even if you manage to put some extra distance from 
     them.
- Blocking doesn't consume stamina based on how much damage you block, it's fixed per attack... which means that an hit 
   that would literally deal no damage still requires the same amount of stamina to block it would've required with worse 
   gear on... making weaker attacks actually better face tanked than blocked and a lot of attacks just not worth it;
- The stagger mechanic: you can get staggered even with full stamina while blocking... which makes fighting strong 
   enemies a lot harder than it needs to be since they're gonna perma stagger you no matter what. Also some enemies have 
   such a short stagger timer in the first place, it's just so hard to capitalize on it even under the best of circumstances;
- Knockback: knockback is so unreliable when used against enemies and it's pretty wonky on the player too: sometimes 
   you'll be sent flying from blocking the weakest attack, sometimes you won't move from the same attack, sometimes 
   parrying an enemy attack will push the enemy so far back you can't capitalize on it, some other times the enemy will be 
   stuck in place and allow you a full combo and even to stunlock them.
 - Multi target damage penalty: while I find this an interesting game mechanic, it's badly implemented and makes every 
   weapon but the sword mostly useless... It could actually be used to differentiate weapons, making some better on 1 vs 1 
   and others better at group control, but it's not the case right now.
 - Enemy aggro: enemies aggro is too heavy... you'll get aggroed from so far away sometimes that you can't even see them 
   coming, especially later on in the game. Also: losing most enemies is hard af even with higher levels in running;
 - Skill levels feel underwhelming and most of the times are just not satisfying even when you do notice the difference;
- Stamina system:
 - Too many actions require an honestly stupidly high amount of stamina (farming, building, mining... it's frustrating);
 - Weapons of higher tier require more stamina to use than weapons of lower tier from the same category, meaning that 
   losing stamina is actually more punishing the higher you weapon tier;
- Bad and missing gear: too many times I've found weapons missing from a tier: Axes, Maces, Bows... which forces you to 
   just not upgrade or to change weapon:
  - Maces are just SO BAD... Unless you use 2 handed hammers, anything after the iron mace is... useless or too situational. 
    Also not every tier has a 1 handed mace;
  - Axes are not weapons: Just use a sword, axes suck, the 2 handed ones are kinda good but still swords are just too much 
    better. Also not every tier has a 1 handed axe to use;
  - Spears are meh: theyr normal attack is... bad and theyr throw is even worse, but at least they're fun to use;
  - Fists are useless unless you use one weapon you get mid game that falls off incredibly fast;
  - 2-handed weapons are far too scarce... there's just not enough of them;
  - Bows are good, but we need more of them: not all tier of equip have them which means sometimes you change 3 times 
     in a single tier, other it takes 3 tiers to change once. Also: no zoom mechanic when firing them; 
- So many pieces are missing from the building mechanic, most of them already exist in game too you just can't get them 
  at all, also: existing pieces can only be rotated on one axis, making the absence of some pieces even more noticeable and 
  limitating;
- Not all crops can be farmed: I know the devs have already expressed themselves on this, but I honestly would love the 
  option to choose both for gameplay purposes and for aestethic purposes: why not make it work like the portals option?
- Hard to control ground level... it's so hard to adjust the ground level or to make a steep but kind of low alture to get a hard 
  to reach high ground;
- Boats get stuck too easily and are too hard to free.

I do like the game and I understand that it's still in early acces... but it's so frustrating to play (especially solo) when so many things go so much against the player...
Do I recommend the game? Sure, definitely, but we need at least the most frustrating aspects fixed.

Optional point I would like but are kinda just personal preferences:
- Make more mobs tameable: Hares and Necks would be cool to tame too (necks could use fish while hares carrots/Jotunn 
   Puffs);
- Add more mobs to older biomes:
 - The meadows lack a big, strong enemy: Maybe add bears?;
 - Rancid Bones are too rare and in general: give all human-type monster access to more weapons;
- Some foods are too easy to amass (like wolf meat... you don't even need to tame them or even cloud berries) while 
   others are too hard to even get (ooze is a good example, but there are quite a few)... maybe make some mobs a bit less 
   rare;
- Serpents are too hard to find: why not make it so they are more likely to appear the more bosses you have slain? Also 
   bring the spwn check counter down... 1000 seconds for each chunk is far too much... make it something like 300/360 
   seconds (5-6 minutes) and maybe make them even more likely to appear with more ppl close;
- Just add more accessories: items like pouches, backpacks and stuff that add more space to the inventory, maybe more 
  accessories that just give different efect (more stam recovery, more health regen, resistance to some damages, more 
  damage with melee weapons, stronger knockback, more stagger resistance, all sorts of effects);
- Add one piece of gear (gloves) and more weapon/armor tiers with different effects (to give more gameplay customization 
  options);
- Give more uses to some materials that are literally used for one thing only and then become totally useless;
- Make ""special"" weapons untiered: poison, fire, thunder, frost, spirit damage should be imho, not within 
  a specific tier of weapons but should rather be upgrades you put on your weapons of choice;
- Add Boss gear: Add some more weapons like the stagbreaker, maybe even give them theyr own special upgrading system 
  that allow them to be relevant later on too.",True,Strategy

Valheim,"Played this as a group of five. We wanted to enjoy this, and at times, we really did. But many of those times it was because we all had something to collectively gripe about.

On paper, Valheim looks great, big open world with many biomes, bosses to overcome, bases to build, armour and weapons to forge and other mechanics on the side for when you need a little downtime.
In reality, a lot of the time it feels like a bunch of loosely related, half thought out mechanics all thrown together to deliver an underwhelming, sometimes frustrating experience. Games need to do one of two things to be good: be original or be well executed. Unfortunately, Valheim achieves neither.

The most robust system in the game is probably the building system; a good number of parts, snapping options, even structural stability needs to be accounted for! While I did tinker with it myself a couple of times, a couple of my teammates spent much more time with it. I think all of us can agree that there's just enough caveats, little problems and inconsistencies in the way it works that what should be a fun or chill time spent building out a new structure in your camp can quickly become frustrating as you try to get pieces to align that just plain refuse to. And that's before you get the land deformation tools involved.

Taking the other extreme as another example, boss fights are quite the spectacle. Theme music for each one, lots of visual effects reserved just for use in that one fight, pretty fleshed out attack sets and the skybox will even change for some of them. They'll happily chew through terrain in their attempts to take you down. 
Bosses are often placed in far flung locations, so players will often need to either travel by portal to get there or set up a little mini-base to reset their spawn to be nearby. And that's the rub; die during a boss fight and you're doomed to spend the remainder of it either sat twiddling your thumbs at home while everyone else cracks on, hoping one of your teammates has the resources, and time, to throw a portal together after your initial location got destroyed or, especially in later bosses, you get stuck in the loop of graverunning, getting mowed down in one of the boss's many many area attacks, rinse, repeat.

This is a pattern throughout pretty much all the various systems in the game. A good idea on paper, but not given quite enough thought to be enjoyable. It feels like they either rushed from design straight into development, or didn't spend the time to circle back and playtest thoroughly.

However, this doesn't mean that Valheim isn't savable. The devs just need to pump the breaks on the content releases and spend time iterating on their mechanics, fleshing them out a little more and adding polish to what they have. I hope they do.

I genuinely hate to dislike games from small and independent studios; they're where the true heart and soul of creative game development lives. However, unfortunately, I really can't recommend Valheim. The enjoyable moments are enough to keep you coming back, but at no point was I looking forward to playing it. While we did complete it, or at least as far as we could with current content, there was a definite sense of relief rather than triumph. After an almost in-game (and real life) year, it was finally over, the challenge was overcome, and we'd be able to move on to something else.",False,Strategy
Valheim,"Valheim – A Masterpiece of Atmosphere and Adventure
Valheim is more than just a survival game, it’s an experience, a world that pulls you in and refuses to let go. In an era where many games focus on realism and hand-holding, Valheim stands out as a breath of fresh air, embracing a PlayStation 2-esque art style that feels both nostalgic and stunning in its own way. The low-poly visuals, reminiscent of RuneScape and The Legend of Zelda, blend seamlessly with its breathtaking lighting and atmospheric effects, creating a world that feels alive.

From the moment you step into Valheim, the world is yours to explore. Odin may have sent you here, but your fate is in your own hands. Whether you choose to carve out a peaceful existence as a builder, fisherman, and farmer or venture into the wilds to challenge the game’s mythical beasts, Valheim offers a deep and rewarding sandbox. Progression follows a gear-based system similar to Terraria, where gathering resources and crafting better equipment is the key to surviving its many dangers.

One of Valheim’s greatest strengths is its dynamic world. One moment, you're lost in the serenity of chopping wood, fishing by the shore, or listening to the ambient sounds of the wind and water. The next, the ground trembles beneath you as trolls emerge from the forest, threatening everything you’ve built. These unexpected moments make every playthrough feel unique and immersive. The game doesn’t hold your hand—it encourages creativity, perseverance, and a true Viking spirit.

Valheim is best with friends, and captures a sense of adventure and camaraderie that other survival games lack. Whether solo or with friends, the game thrives on emergent storytelling—epic battles, daring raids, and tales of survival that rival those of legendary sagas.

For those seeking a survival game that values atmosphere, challenge, and freedom, Valheim is a must-play. It’s not just a game, it’s a journey, and one that you’ll want to relive time and time again.

Valheim,"From the concept, to the graphics, game-play, and sound design, this game is a piece of art. It captures the Survival / Crafting / Base building / Exploration aspect of the genre while seamlessly blending it into beautiful proceeduraly generated worlds and guides you at your own pace to explore and learn of the vengeful inhabitants of the 10th realm. 

The game can be played equally well solo at your own pace, or with friends for maximum shinnanigans and the multiplayer system is both simiple and streamlined allowing for the transfer of characters, resources, and even map data to keep everyone caught up and swinging their axes as hordes of dark beasts try to crush you and your companions. 

There are a number of resource grinds in the game that can slow down the pace of progression for those who like to unlock everything and get maximum upgrades, but players much more skilled than I have proven that you arent required to completely build up before reaching each new game stage, but if you're struggling, then spending some time farming for new foods, or digging up more ore to upgrade weapons and armor, or building up your strongholds to gain access to new tools offers a respite from the carnage allowing you to engage with the game however you wish and dictate your playstyle. 

There's a lot that could be said about specific mechanics or updates or biomes or bosses, but I encourage players to discover these for themselves as the fun of playing a game is, well, playing the game! All in all, it's a wonderful game and I can not recommend it highly enough.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"Truly one of the greatest recent games in the last 5, maybe even 10 years. The developers have put enormous effort into this game, and they are doing good on their word to bring this game to 1.0 so that it's complete. I only played maybe 12 hours at release and really enjoyed it, but now early 2025 this game has so much that's been breathed into it. The building ALONE is one of my favorite things about this game. It can take some getting used to at first, but finishing your first house truly is an amazing feeling.

Where this game really shines in my opinion is the exploration and the progression. Venturing into new zones are dangerous and you need to ease into it and be as prepared as possible, because you are going to die, and it is going to be a steep learning curve once you get to the swamp. (which I'm still navigating) When you get an upgrade, you SERIOUSLY feel it. The jump you make even from a simple flint dagger to a bronze sword really makes you feel like you earned it, and upgrading your gear feels so good. 

Be prepared for a long haul on this game. If you rush it, you're doing it wrong. Build up a base, explore, gather, and over prepare yourself, because you're going to need it for the difficult foes.

All in all, if you're on the fence about starting this, I can say this is one of the best games I've ever played, and the changelog alone is pretty impressive to see how frequently the devs are updating to make the game as stable as possible.

Valheim,"I decided to give Valheim a try after reading several recommendations on Reddit—boy, was that a mistake. The game has been in early access since early 2021, and nearly four years later, it still feels severely lacking in content.

At first, Valheim has a certain charm, but that quickly wears off once you realize how bare-bones it is. The world feels empty, with only 3-5 enemy types per biome. After venturing beyond the Black Forest, the second biome, it becomes painfully obvious how repetitive and lifeless the world is. While the procedurally generated map might seem vast, it fails to provide meaningful content. Each biome forces you to fight the same handful of enemies repeatedly, making exploration feel like a chore rather than an adventure.

On top of that, the game is a massive time sink. Gathering ore takes hours, hunting deer takes hours—you get the idea. Normally, I wouldn't mind a grind-heavy game, but the issue here is that the effort rarely feels rewarding. The biomes are half-baked, the combat is clunky, and all the weapons feel like they share the same dull animations. Even the boss fights are lackluster; Moder, the ice dragon, can barely move properly in its own environment.

And one more thing—I dislike when players claim this game is complex and requires planning. No, it doesn’t. It takes neither skill nor strategy. Sailing for two hours across an empty, unfinished ocean just to find a boss locator—because the first ten identical islands didn’t have one—isn’t ""depth""; it’s just bad game design.

Even writing this review drained my stamina bar, and now I'm stuck in my chair, dreading the fact that I played this game longer than I should have—believing other players when they said, ""it gets better."" It doesn’t.

Overall, I’d give Valheim a 6/10. Calling it ""early access"" at this point feels like pure copium from its hardcore fans.

Valheim,"A game with good bones that unfortunately didn't build upon them in a meaningful way. 

Every single biome is just get the new crop to make better food, spend an absurd amount of time mining the new ore to make the same weapons and armor with higher numbers, then fight the boss. The Mistlands at least finally provided some variation on this by introducing magic and weapon enchantments, but pretty much every other biome is identical in progression and has nothing new to offer  beyond ""enemy that does more damage"".

This would make the game fairly mediocre already, but what finally pushes it over the edge into a negative review is the glacially slow development of the game. Since launch into EA in 2021 the only major updates to the game have been 2 additional biomes and one update that added more to build at your base. The other 2 ""named"" updates just added 2 new traders that barely change anything about the game.

So essentially over 4 years of development we got 2 new biomes to do the exact same loop as the previous ones, and a magic system that you cant even access til you're near the end of the game.

Combat is simple but satisfying, and progressing through the bosses gives a real sense of achievement. Playing with friends makes it even better.

Valheim,"If you're like me and having an unfinished campaign in a game leaves you increasingly uneasy the longer it drags out, then this is not a game for you.

You'd probably have to pour in a full man-month of WORK to finish the bosses. And it feels like work. Which is absolutely absurd and I am ashamed that I kept going so long just to ""get over with it"".
The devs provide some facilities in order to make the game a bit less time intensive. I did use them, yet, they weren't nearly enough. I had to resort to cheats to keep myself going to the last boss of the originally released game. I have absolutelty no desire to see what the new biomes and bosses are about. Anyway, I think I have a pretty good Idea about the gameplay loop at this point: 
- You get into a new biome and get your arse handed to you by the new mobs. 
- You start the tedious process of mining and gathering the new resources. This usually drags out a few hours since most gear is abysmally expensive. At this point you'll get the feeling that this is just to squeeze the last bit of playtime out of the few bits of new content that are actually there.
(- if you're insane enough to not activate teleporting metals in standard portals you'll be ferrying your ressources across the ocean a few times. Add another half hour per trip.)
- Once you're strong enough to navigate the new biome somewhat routinely, it's time to think about the next boss. However, you have to find him first. For some bosses, I literally had to scan six or seven biomes. I searched four or five hours for Yagluth and online discussions imply that I was lucky to find him that quickly. And apparently this gets worse for the later bosses. 
- Every single boss after the first one takes just fucking forever to kill. There is a fine line between a tough boss and one where even the intended way of fighting him feels cheesy because you're doing the same movement over and over and over again - Valheim manages to overshoot that line by a german mile.
If you're not actively looking for a game to waste your time, then this game is not for you.",False,Strategy

Valheim,"I've enjoyed this game for years now.  Mother of 2 teens/preteens- this is the ideal family game...  My husband and both of my kids enjoy it.  We love playing together and working on building projects or boss fights.  My brother and a few of our friends who live across the world also join us periodically in spurts. It is a good space for bonding with those you love as well showcasing each individual's personal creativity.  We adults very much enjoy the difficulty of survival.. We have our server set to ""player based progression"" so that someone who hasn't reached certain difficulty mile-markers doesn't experience the raids at their base as heavily as those of us who love harder content.  That update has made this game worlds better for muti-player since some love difficult content and some enjoy just building/farming.  You can play this game cooking/farming/building ""stardew valley"" style or you can be a murder hobo who likes a giant challenge.  The building options are fun and superb.

The building is excellent and gives you a nice break from the battling. The boss fights are exciting and exponentially more difficult. Its a game that rewards you for your preparation and punishes you for your lack of it. It respects your skills to the point that you can survive on them but also allows you to mitigate the need for perfect parries and perfect stamina management with ol' fashion preparation although there will be times you inevitably get yourself in some very stick situations. I cant stress enough how much this game punishes you for being unprepared and humbles you when your hubris is showing.",True,Strategy

I'm very big into building in survival crafting games, and the freedom and challenges offered by Valheims build system is the best among any game I've played. There's also plenty of survival, crafting, exploration, progression mechanics to keep things interesting long into playing the game. As well as plenty of fun and hi-jinks you can get up to alone or with friends.

I especially enjoy the ability to play with others without complications. I haven't run across any glitches or bugs when playing with others on a server I pay for, or when we're just playing PC-to-PC. This is definitely in my top 3 of open world survival/crafting games.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"I like Valheim a lot, but I think it needs some balancing before it is ready for its full 1.0 release. Either that, or it needs more server settings to compensate for certain gameplay decisions that some of its playerbase may not appreciate as much at others. This may be your cup of tea, but you may also fall into my camp and you'll need an update before you can give the game your full, wholehearted endorsement. My endorsement as it is, I feel about 70% satisfied.

Essentially, when I only have about 2-3 hours on the weekends to play this game with my friend, we are under constant awareness of the real-life time pressures that we're under in order to experience all the content this game has to offer. We like completing the co-op games that we buy, but Valehim suffers severely from diminishing returns and punishing balance issues that make it a frustrating slog to play through with its intended mechanics.

We disabled the portals issue where you can't teleport with ore, because we thought this was absolutely exhausting. And we played the game legitimately up until around the late mountains/early plains biome before we found ourselves regularly cheating, because it ended up not being worth the real-life time investment to travel back to our bodies, get our stuff back, risk getting sniped by a mosquito in the process, and do it over and over again. Or, it ended up not being worth the real-life time investment to go and farm ingredients from previous, unchallenging zones, so we'd cheat in the ingredients in order to continue progression at a worthwhile pace. 

This is due to a mismatch in personal values from the intended game experience vs. the real life time commitment required to progress. While some players may enjoy the punishing grind that this game demands of its audience, I found that the frustration factor slowly ate away the fun factor until I was worn down and the temptation of regularly cheating got too much to bear.

I still am having fun with it. We are exploring the Mistlands now, though based on what I know of the Ashlands biome, this might be the biome that fully does in my patience to complete the game. The game's later zones seems to have mistaken ""frustrating grind"" for ""challenge."" My friend and I love a challenge; we enjoyed V Rising immensely and were not compelled to cheat to progress. Valheim, however, offers ""challenge"" in the form of ""oh no! You ran out of a low-tier ingredient, and have to spend hours farming up more food!"" or ""Oh no! You got randomly sniped by a mob because you got stuck on a piece of world geometry and the mob was 2 pixels higher than your sword was, so even though your sword visibly connected with the mob, you actually hit the ground and you ran out of stamina and then died. Guess you have to run all the way back to your body and try not to die again in the process! Oh, and you also have to eat a bunch of your good food so you can survive the journey! :)"" 

Some mobs also become bullet sponges in the late game, and the game doesn't give you the gear upgrades necessary to combat them in a timely manner. The mobs that flood the Infested Mines take a very long time to kill with the tier of gear that we have access to- and I know that these mines have cores which will give us access to the next tier of gear- but we went through like 6 of these mines and there were only 1-2 cores in each when we need like, 15. This requires sailing to other Mistlands islands, finding more of these dungeons, only to disappointedly get 2 cores out, rinse and repeat.

Compare to the challenge of the early game dungeons, where you only needed to raid about 2-3 of them to find enough Sultring Cores needed to build your first forge. The early dungeons were still challenging for the level of gear and food we had access to, but it wasn't such a huge time sink as to demand us to invest 10 hours of gameplay time just to get the ingredients to progress.

Therefore, I think this issue would be fixed by adding a few settings for more casual players like me, such as: option to not drop ANYTHING on death, and increase the spawn rate of items. More cores in the late dungeons, more drops from mobs, more drops from farmed ingredients, less time required to process said ingredients. It would also help to reduce the health pool of the more tankier mobs that take a long time to kill. I also think the game's physics should be tweaked slightly to make getting stuck on world geometry less egregious; I can't tell you how many times I stabbed a monster only for my dagger to strike a tiny particle of land that was in my way, eat away my stamina, and leave me open for an unfair counterattack. (And I HATE it when I 'fail' in a video game due to no fault of my own, but a fault of mechanics that seem unintended.)

All that said, when Valheim works, it works really well. There's a fun gameplay loop between base building and combat progression. I love the chill aspects of building up a Viking settlement and making it function efficiently. I like the feeling of power progression as you gain access to stronger and stronger gear, which makes traversal of older zones trivial. It makes you feel that you are truly contending with the corrupt gods of the land, and becoming a powerhouse in turn. I enjoy discovering new areas, learning the tricks to traversing them, and conquering the mobs that live there. There is nothing wrong with the difficulty of the experience- only the times where it feels artificially contrived just to make you invest more and more time in each new zone. While some people do think this is challenging and want a pure hardcore experience, I really don't have the time in my life for that.

TLDR: ""Difficulty"" should not equate to ""takes a longer time to do things."" I've got things to do and places to be. The game should fundamentally respect my time.",True,Strategy

Valheim,"Valheim – An Unforgettable Viking Adventure

Valheim is more than just a survival game—it's an epic journey filled with adventure, camaraderie, and unforgettable memories. I first stepped into this vast and beautifully crafted world alongside five friends, and together, we faced countless challenges, built mighty settlements, and explored every corner of its mythical lands. One of our greatest achievements was defeating Fader, the formidable boss of the Ashlands, a battle that pushed our skills and teamwork to the limit.

But Valheim's magic doesn’t fade. I’m preparing to return once more, ready to take on Fader again and gear up for the highly anticipated Deep North update. The game’s constant evolution, immersive exploration, and rewarding progression make every playthrough feel fresh and exciting. Whether you're sailing treacherous seas, battling fearsome creatures, or simply enjoying the beauty of this Viking-inspired world, Valheim offers an adventure unlike any other.

Valheim,"9.5/10. Highly recommend. Valheim is the survivalcraft game that kickstarted a million others trying to ride its success and recapture its magic. They all fail. Here's why:

1. Crafting is with Lego's, not Pre-Fabs
You want to make a toilet, a bar, a pool table? Do it with the 1x1 wall pieces, item stands, and name signs Valheim gives you and feel great about it. There's no bathtub piece that you can only place a certain way. You can build whatever you want and in whatever orientation you want to, all within a fun physics system that allows you to build in trees and off the sides of cliffs in weird but satisfying ways.

2. No Resource Bloat
In so many survivalcraft games you lose track of the infinitude of ingredients, crafting stations, and so on, all just to make a bunch of armors and items you'll never use. Valheim doesn't (or at least not until Mistlands...). Think you won't need a poison resist potion? Think again. Every enemy drops something you can use, and everything you can make from the small shelf of ingredients you do find has a use.

2. No Polygons, No Problem
Visually, Valheim knows what makes a game look good: internal art consistency, and lighting. That's it. This game looks like it could've come out in 2000 (and will run on a computer of that age too), but looks better than most triple A games. More polygons are not always better. Understanding how to use those polygons is what matters.

3. Grinding can be Fun? 
Unlike every other game that has you collect wood and stone by pressing a key enough times in the most boring fashion possible, Valheim lets you chain together trees by felling them into each other. It's hard to describe how satisfying that is. Or, you can mine out the entire area of earth around an ore vein so the vein explodes all at once. Try it with silver in the mountains. So satisfying. If fishing had the Stardew Valley minigame, it would be perfect!

4. Difficult, but not Impossible. Challenging, but Fair. Brutal, but Beatable.
Valheim (until the custom settings update) had aura. It was legendary. When you heard Valheim, you thought despair-inducing, seemingly unscaleable mountain that many will be unable or unwilling to defeat. 
...But not because it was cheap or unfair or ridiculous, but rather because you, the player, couldn't measure up. 
If you scale this mountain called Valheim, the catharsis of knowing what you've achieved is worth it. The time you spent in this game will have felt infinitely more meaningful than the time you spent in so many others.

5. Shared Trauma
Play with a small group of friends, not alone. This game was designed for a party. You will bond with that group over your shared failures. And then overcoming those failures. Playing with others becomes playing FOR others. You will become soldiers in a foxhole, all fighting for each other, for survival, and for victory.  

A few missteps:
The Mistlands. What happened to cause this 6th zone to diverge so much from the first 5? This feels like a different game, and not in a good way. Resource bloat, a boss with way, way too many summons, limited number of P.O.I.'s and difficult-to-access resources for a zone so horrendous to navigate. First, this biome reduces your vision range so you can't plan out where you're going or how to backtrack. And the wisp that clears the mist (so you can see) follows you on a delay, forcing you to constantly wait for it to catch up with you and reveal the terrain in front of you. This in itself isn't terrible, but it becomes terrible because the Mistlands terrain is nothing but jagged and steep mountains that spill into dangerous rivers and lakes. It is too unnavigable, even after acquiring the feather cape. Improve this by either having the wisp clear the mist permanently in places you've been, or at least have the mountains topographically marked on the map so you can actually chart a course through the zones. As it stands, the Mistlands (despite how cool magic is to use) remains a black mark on an otherwise nearly perfect game.
Also note that foggy weather while sailing is in the same vein. Having vision reduction is fine, but complete obfuscation feels terrible because it lacks counterplay. Ocean fog, especially with storms and/or nighttime can reduce visibility by 90%. Maybe dial that back to 80% so it's still extremely dangerous and realistic, but so that you aren't completely ruined if you happen to bad rng roll this weather while sailing back home with a boatload of ore.

Lastly, and this may be unpopular, but another misstep was an update allowing players the ability to fully customize the game's difficulty parameters. Valheim used to stand out more in this genre because it unapologetically staked a claim on what it stood for and the shared player experiences that raised Valheim to its legendary, if not mythical status: 
zones with enemies that will initially annihilate you (remember your first time encountering a troll?), 
dangerous ore harvesting (remember when you wrecked your ore-laden ship while sailing back to base?), 
corpse run-death-loops (remember the first time you died in the mountains or wherever and couldn't get your gear back because you didn't make backup weapons and armor?), 
and seemingly impossible bosses that force you to discover and utilize the counterplay the game provides (remember when bonemass murdered you, but then you made poison resist potions and grabbed a mace?) 

Allowing players to subvert this and do whatever they want isn't freedom; it's anarchy. It marginalizes Valheim's identity and diminishes the shared experiences I just listed. These experiences are what make a game mythical and give that feeling of satisfaction and catharsis in a playerbase. Now, with full customization, Valheim is one thing for some and something completely else for others. There's a more diverse community, but the community itself is less. It's quantity over quality, which I disagree with. Maybe full customization sells more copies, but it tarnishes Valheim's aura, it's mythical status. Instead of being THAT game, it becomes just another game. 
Perhaps there's a middle ground here: if there were just a few difficulty settings like Sandbox, Casual, Pure Valheim, and maybe even a Brutal difficulty mode, this would accomplish the goal of broadening accessibility but without losing what made Valheim ""Valheim"" to everyone who played it on its intended factory settings.",True,Strategy

Valheim,"Review Checklist Linux Edition

This game is great! It's like Ark in a lot of ways but also quite different. And it runs wayyy better. You can even tame creatures but the game doesn't make this known or explain it - Youtube is your friend in a lot of such cases. It can be a bit tricky to understand how to get started at first but your best bet is to start by fixing up one of the existing structures for your starter home before committing to a fully fledged base. The progression is weird in such a way that building the optimal base is not possible until a ways into the game.

My only gripe at this point is - please, please add a secondary destroy option for unwanted items. I don't want to have to use console commands to do this and dropping items on the ground adds unnecessary instances, in addition to accidentally picking them up again. Dropping them in the ocean is an option but if you're too close to your base, they will never despawn.

Valheim,The game is pretty smooth on almost every aspect of the game.  It is a great survival type game with minimal assistance which makes you explore more and figure out on your own.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the building mode.  Took a lot of work to snap things in the correct place.  Overall I would give it a 9/10,True,Strategy
Valheim,"Absolutely worth the money at full price. The mod support is top notch. It can get a bit grindy at times, but there is always a mod for whatever bothers you.

This is an easy 10/10.",True,Strategy
Valheim,"For a little indie game it's quite good if you are into survival base building games you will definitely enjoy it. It's become one of my all time favorite survival games after 800+ hours on 5 different playthroughs. Some of the biggest pros the game offers is it's massive randomly generated seeds. Every time you go into a seed it feels fresh because of how random everything is you get the feeling that you are adventuring and finding something unique. This is a feature that is done very well in this game most of these survival games get very stale after a play through or two so this feature keeps it interesting. Another big pro this game offers is it's rewarding progression system. Every time you go into a new biome you will run into a lot of issues especially when you are a new player. The enemies are much tougher the weather is much harsher the terrain is more brutal and harder to navigate etc. But by grinding/gathering and slowly making your way deeper you will slowly conquer the area that you once found terrifying at the beginning with ease. Another thing I liked a lot about this game is there isn't really a real ""path"" you are supposed to take. Outside of Ashlands which is the newest biome you arent really restricted to traveling into a certain direction. You can pick a direction and just go this is one of the best things about this game it allows you to adventure and discover regardless of where you travel initially. Building can be fun and I think Valhiem is one of the harder games to build something and make it look really nice. So if you are able to do that it does feel good and look awesome.

Now some things that the game doesn't do so great and keeps it from being one of my top 10 all time favorite games. The combat is lack luster and clunky. It does slightly improve once you level up skills and have high tier foods but it never truly comes online like some other great combat systems such as Darksouls. It remains janky all through the game even when you are endgame with magic stuff. Like how you aren't able to hit enemies that are on slops or how you cannot use weapons if you are in the water etc these things never get better and imo is not a very good combat system. The game is unplayable without Rested Buff also. There are weird design choices that I personally believe are just bad. Some examples you cannot drink meads to reset buffs until the timer runs out. But at the same time you are able to eat more food after half the time has expired to replenish it's effects. Later in the game you unlock magic there is a staff of protection that gives you a barrier to absorb damage taken. If you recast the barrier spell it will reset the timer of the barrier but it will not reset the Health points on the barrier shield itself. Some would argue that is because the staff is op so they don't want it to be even more op. I call BS, I would argue why even let you reset the timer at all if you are not able to reset the shield health also? What would be the point in resetting the shield timer then? Might as well treat it like the Mead buffs then and make players wait for barrier to either break or for timer to run out completely before being able to recast. It feels like they don't know what they want exactly when it comes to some of their mechanics and systems so it's just random and it doesn't make much sense. Imagine making a game with Vikings and then restricting the player from being able to drink more mead until he has completely sobered. It just doesn't make sense if I'm being honest.

These are some of the few gripes that keeps it from being 10/10 masterpiece for me. But overall it is still one of my favorite games.",True,Strategy

Europa Universalis IV,"I played EU4 much closer to release and logged most of my 300+ hours then. Really enjoyed it. Understood it. Loved it. If I reviewed it then it would have been a positive review. But I am reviewing it now after trying to pick it up again after a couple year break and will be submitting this review based on my recent experience which was... not great.

So I reinstalled EU4 thinking with over 300 hours in the game I should be able to pick it up relatively easy. Nope. Spent an hour and change clicking around different menus before quitting in confusion. It's a dense game, okay. Spent an hour and a half on the wiki, looking up general information, trying to familiarize myself with EU4 again. Next day, better idea of what's going on, I log in and spend half an hour looking through different menus before again quitting in confusion. Lot has changed since the last time I played.

Okay, I watch the first part of a a let's play starter guide for Brandenburg. I played them before, did a partial world conquest years ago, I have been staring at their menus for almost 2 hours at this point, it should be easy to follow. And it is! I write down everything the streamer does thinking I will analyze what all the options mean and try to piece out why those were good decisions. I go into the game, start following the list, and one of the estate options I am supposed to do is not in my game. Apparently it's specific to the domination DLC. $20 bucks. Hmm. Oh well, keep calm and carry on. I can probably still follow this guide and get a feel for the game. Hm. One of the diplomatic options the streamer uses, 'curry favor' is not in my game. Apparently that's specific to the leviathan DLC. $20 bucks. Wait - I think my mission tree options look different than his mission tree options. Yes, locked behind specific DLCs, there, too. And that's my breaking point. Quit out. Uninstall.  Decide to write this review to vent my frustration.

I am betting EU4 is still a fantastic game for those that have been consistently playing and keeping up with the DLC as they come out, learning little by little what's changed. If you are looking to play EU4 now after a long break, though, just don't. If you are looking to get into EU4 for the first time, just don't. At the same time it's somehow become both bloated and chopped up through DLCs. So unless you want to get the EU4 subscription service - which I think is an awful model for the video game industry to adopt - the game just isn't playable. Such a frustrating shame.",False,Strategy

Europa Universalis IV,"I really really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It's far too complicated and you can spend hours building something just to be torn down by a situation you could not have foreseen because of said complexity.

I ended up with the same number of loans for some reason immediately after, and my country just fell apart completely. I don't even know how I got there so how can I avoid such a situation next time? Just don't use the button? Then why is it there if it basically wrecks your entire game?

Europa Universalis IV,"Europa Universalis IV – The Ultimate “Suffer Now, Enjoy Later” Simulator
Before I got into Europa Universalis IV, I bought it, got overwhelmed, and refunded it. Three times. Then, I bought it again. This time, I had a friend hold my hand through the brutal learning curve, because let’s be honest—this game does not care if you understand how it works.

Years later, I tried to return to it after a long break. Big mistake. I booted it up, looked at all the menus, and immediately realized: I had no idea what I was doing. Again. It’s the kind of game where if you don’t play for a while, you basically have to relearn everything from scratch. Nothing about EU4 is intuitive. The UI? Cluttered. The mechanics? Complicated. The tutorials? Might as well be written in Latin.

And yet… I still recommend it.

Because despite the suffering, despite the hours of not having fun while just learning how to play, I put 363+ hours into it. Clearly, I saw something in it that kept me coming back. Once you break through the barrier of confusion, EU4 becomes an incredibly deep and rewarding experience.

So if you’re willing to spend hours struggling, being confused, and questioning your life choices—all for the eventual payoff of mastering a grand strategy masterpiece—yeah, Europa Universalis IV is a pretty damn good game.

[list]
    [*] The performance is relatively bad considering the vast majority of assets and lighting are static and there aren't any expensive visuals or calculations going on
    [*] There are some game-breaking bugs. Most annoyingly, many curves can not be trusted because running along it, you might hit an invisible corner, sending you flying. In every 10th game someone gets to a spot where they don't respawn but can't get out themselves (e.g. under the map, inside an asset, etc.). If the ball is close to a wall the camera is unusable to the point where you don't see the ball anymore (Not a bug, but there could be a better solution).
    [*] The visuals are basic which I think is fine for such a game but some things look bad, like clunky animations. Sometimes in the right camera angle some assets turn invisible.
    [*] The price is pretty high considering there is only a very limited selection of maps. DLCs cost 9€ despite receiving very negative reviews concerning invisible corners and bugs. This leaves a particular bad taste since it makes the whole game feel like a cash grab after it became successful.

Golf With Your Friends,"The go-to for a middle-of-the-road experience. 

Middle of the road is essential for your collection. Sometimes you want to play a game while half checked-out. It’s a competent experience that you can get bored of in a single session.  But you return to it time after time. After owning it for years you’re still refining your technique. 

I’ve played against my girlfriend like a zillion times. At first I would handily win nearly every game, being a longtime gamer whereas she is new to it all. Now it’s a dead even match like it should be, with the games being mostly decided by unforced errors. But if we have the super jump option on I take bigger risks and can sometimes pull off some krazy stunts. 

The graphics are nice. I had a new appreciation for how good they are after playing on someone’s Xbox, where this game didn’t look so great. Everything about the visuals imparts an overwhelming sense of fun. Slightly cheesy. But it’s good to let yourself just drink it in and accept that. 

The physics, courses, powerups, customization, game options, and controls are all just above average. But since every one of those categories are, it makes for an overall experience that really makes the grade. I could put up a wishlist for changes in each of those categories, but none has a dealbreaker either. It passes muster. 

I want more from it. The dlc so far is all justified in my opinion. It doesn’t feel held back or spoon-fed. But it’s now reached its limit where the next game should be released. The price per course of adding dlc will soon make it a bad deal as a single game. And the new game should have new stuff! I want to see gameplay get deeper, but if simplicity was a key part of this one’s success, I understand if they’ll stick with that. 

COMPLAINT : I spent a very long time without my computer connecting to the internet. It seems that some things are dependent on that. The play time is very wrong. We have played MUCH more than 69 hours. But that’s not the problem. The problem is that we never get rewards for playing. They show up extremely rarely and when they do it’s 90% of the time something we already have. Sabertooth skull and red trail over and over and over. So despite playing a crazy amount of time we have barely anything unlocked. It’s not SO bad but being awarded the same item for the millionth time is a little maddening.

Battlefield 4™,"This is still the greatest game of all time. The graphics are still out of this world and the overall gameplay depth remains unmatched. 

!! For those that are getting the game now and are getting kicked by PunkBuster first learn to look up online for a solution before review bombing the game!!

** The solution to this issue is done by launching the pbsvc.exe in the game files to install the anti-cheat. If the issue persists reinstall it again or head to the evenbalance website to update it. ** 

If you run into the error code 1 you simply need to launch a quickmatch search and wait till you load into a game. You can now leave and it should be fixed.

The camaraderie between you and your squad is so nice, the gunplay is great, there are some pretty beautiful locations...
Of course the story is pretty average for any FPS campaign and it's somehow buggier now than when I did my first playthrough on my old laptop in 2014 and my second playthrough on this same PC in 2016

Battlefield 4™,"Battlefield 4 is the kind of game that makes you feel like a badass one minute and like you’re just part of an explosive accident the next. Seriously, one second you’re sniping across the map, racking up kills, and the next, you’re accidentally running straight into a tank—talk about a bad day at work. It’s not just about killing the enemy, though (though that’s definitely a big part of it). You’ll also have to master flying helicopters, driving tanks, and navigating through buildings that can be leveled by artillery, all while your squad yells at you to “revive me!” The level of chaos is real, and sometimes, it feels like you’re in the middle of a Michael Bay movie… except with more random explosions, less logic, and a lot more chaos. But hey, if you’re into feeling like you’re a part of an action-packed war movie, then Battlefield 4 is the perfect ride.

Battlefield 4 is a large-scale, first-person shooter that emphasizes teamwork, strategic combat, and epic battles across vast maps. With an impressive selection of vehicles like tanks, helicopters, boats, and jets, you’ll be able to pick your poison when it comes to how you want to dominate the battlefield. The game features a dynamic destruction system that allows you to blow up everything from walls to entire buildings, adding a layer of strategy as you can obliterate cover and force enemies out of hiding. The core of the gameplay revolves around the four classes—Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon—each offering a unique set of abilities and tools that contribute to the overall success of your team. Whether you’re dropping ammo for teammates, providing long-range sniper support, or repairing a tank in the middle of a firefight, there’s always something for everyone to do. The maps are huge and diverse, offering urban warfare, open deserts, and tropical jungles, ensuring that no two rounds ever feel quite the same. It’s chaotic, intense, and incredibly satisfying when everything clicks.

What truly sets Battlefield 4 apart from other shooters is its combination of epic scale, tactical gameplay, and unpredictable, all-out warfare. The destruction mechanic isn’t just a flashy gimmick—it’s a game-changer. Whether you’re planning a tactical assault or just going for broke, the way the environment can change in real time forces you to constantly adapt your strategy. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing an entire skyscraper collapse as you make your escape from an enemy squad, or the heart-racing moments when you’re piloting a jet through the sky, narrowly avoiding missiles from an enemy helicopter. The game has aged like a fine wine, offering a well-rounded mix of intense infantry combat, vehicle warfare, and strategic objectives. If you’re a fan of large-scale combat, teamwork, and a shooter that rewards both skill and strategy, Battlefield 4 is definitely worth your time. Whether you’re a newcomer to the series or a seasoned vet, the game has something to offer for everyone—and yes, you’ll still get plenty of opportunities to blow stuff up.",True,Strategy

Battlefield 4™,"Not as good as its praised to be honest.
Engine, graphics, sounds, animations, gunplay - topnotch as in every BF. Even as a dated game this is still very good and should also run on older hardware with very high fps (120+).
Levolution (destruction of environment) is amazing and its a mystery to me why newer games dont use this as much or expand on it.
 
Negatives about graphics - some scenes are WAY to dark, but when u crank ur brightness up theres as many scenes than that are way to bright.
Amateurish enough - this is still a thing 12 years later in BF 2042 - not as often but still (2042 Caspian Border buildings).
Aprox every 4th serverjoin the game just freezes and refuse to do anything - alt-f4 and rejoin than it works - EA quality as always.

Gameplay wise here as infantry you are just cannonfodder for the vehicles. Balance is HEAVILY leaned towards vehicle play.
If you dont get one - you die and cant do shit.
Ofc planes and choppers are OP asf here - also still a thing in Bf2042. Really weird that one since they nailed the balance in Bf1.
Additionaly unlocking is a MAJOR pain in the ass.
And you have to unlock EVERYTHING. Even with the help of battlepacks that you get alot now right at start.
You will die alot without any chance because you are a beginner and dont know shit but because also your euqipment just SUX big time.
Most other players have played this for years now and will just wipe the floor with you.
And ofc theres movement glitches/exploits that the pros use all day long. Ofc not fixed by DICE, nope.
So all in all. If u want the good ol Infantry only Metro madness from BF3 - you can have that here, theres plenty of maps and modes that provide that.
But the major thing here is vehicle play with inf as cannonfodder. 
If thats ur thing this is best BF for it.

Singleplayer campaign - in the top ten of the worst ever ive played.
Theres no real gameplay here. Aim at red triangles thats it.
Everything is fake. Ofc theres the typical murican we-are-the-good-guys-army-bs. Lots of empty blablablub and screaming and overdramatic music. 
Explosions every second. Lots of bloom, lensflare, shiny surfaces and over the top contrast scenes, probably to hide all the ugly sides of the graphics.
Theres constantly something bright in ur face that blinds u - ALWAYS. Annoying asf. 
Whoever designed the achievemnts for this should be forced to play this until the end of his stupid life, because u have to replay this multiple times if u want everything done, and when playing this just ONE time is already a fcking chore... well...  asshole achievement design at its finest.",True,Strategy

A few downsides, controller support is better but not great. As far as I can tell you still need mouse to navigate resupply menus. AI in singleplayer could be better. You see enemies spawn in often and you team is less than useless, which feels like a missed opportunity.

""A warzone plagued with glitches, lag, and endless frustration.""

Battlefield 4 had the potential to be an incredible shooter, but even years later, it’s still riddled with issues that make it a struggle to enjoy.

Netcode & Hit Registration – Expect to die behind cover, trade kills constantly, or empty an entire magazine into an enemy just for them to turn around and one-shot you. The lag compensation is a disaster.

Buggy & Inconsistent Gameplay – Rubberbanding, random crashes, and vehicles that sometimes handle like they have a mind of their own.

Ghost Chopper in Shanghai – A helicopter that appears out of nowhere, only to vanish just as quickly.
Ghost People Disappearing into Thin Air – Enemies and even teammates sometimes blink out of existence right in front of your eyes.

Unsyced Audio & Broken Rendering – The game often fails to load visuals properly, making it look like an unfinished pre-production build.

Infinite Loop Jump on the Invisible USS Titan – Either you’re stuck in an endless jumping animation, or you fall into the abyss.

Swimming Inside the Titan Bug – The most infuriating experience. I had to spend 20 minutes holding W just to progress.

DirectX 11 Rendering Problems – DX11 makes the game a buggy mess, though switching to Mantle improves things slightly.

Infinite Black Screen Loading Bug – Because waiting forever to play is part of the experience.

That being said, BF4’s gameplay is better than BF3, but the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, and technical problems make it a frustrating experience.

Through all this suffering, I finally completed the campaign—a game I started but never finished a decade ago. And for that, at least, it was worth it.

Salute to Dimitri ""Dima"" Mayakovsky, who once rotted in the gulag. Rest in peace, my friend. It was his purpose—a glorious purpose.

Battlefield 4™,"Bought the game with high hopes of it being a great story mode game. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is probably the biggest disappointment I've ever had regarding a story mode game. 

The game is filled with glitches and bugs, sometimes even so game breaking that you have to restart the mission and read forums on how to fix it. Visual bugs, where characters disappear on the corner of your screen, sometimes you fall through the floor and on the 3rd mission you have to swim underwater... except your character can't swim.

The story itself on a larger scale is a pretty cool concept - China and US all out war. But how it gets presented through the eyes of the main protagonist is lame, repetitive and overall boring. They try so hard to make you feel attached to your squad mates, but it feels so bland, unreasonable, rushed and emotionless that none of their deaths actually matter and to you, the player they were nobodies.

Gameplay is just attrocious. I played on normal difficulty and the game is stupidly easy. In fact the hardest part of it is to navigate through the cluttered map with linear, stupid tasks you have to do. This is one of those games in which you're the main character and you have to do EVERYTHING. From opening all of the doors and hatches to killing literally every single enemy to progress through the mission. The hitboxes suck, the maps rarely offer you comfortable cover, the enemy units are dumb as rocks and hide on the farthest corners of the map(you have to find them and kill them to finish the sequence). Oh and the story is about you and your squad right? Yeah, well your squad ain't doing shit. They're essentially non-existent as none of their bullets deal damage, they don't even distract the enemy and they can't die - what's the point of them?

Graphics are.. alright? Considering the age of the game, it looks good. My only complaints would be the visual bugs like random floating flames, ships and helicopters not having any indication of them firing(but you die anyway, it looks like telekenisis), sometimes weapons and units warp through each other, etc.

One more thing, the game required Origin to launch. :)

Overall, the game has an awful first impression on my try of Battlefield games. I do not recommend it on PC.",False,Strategy

PAYDAY 2 has been a staple for co-op heist gameplay for years, offering a variety of missions, a robust progression system, and countless opportunities for teamwork. However, after years of patches and DLCs, it still has some serious flaws that hold it back from being the masterpiece it could have been.

Why It’s Still Worth Playing
💰 Fun Core Gameplay – At its heart, PAYDAY 2 offers fun, adrenaline-pumping heists that are perfect for team coordination. Whether stealth or all-out action, there’s a lot of satisfaction in completing a mission.

🔫 Customization & Loadouts – The game boasts huge weapon customization options. You can fine-tune your guns, gear, and skills, allowing for deep personal style when planning heists.

🤑 Tons of Content – Over the years, PAYDAY 2 has accumulated a wealth of DLCs, weapons, and heists, offering a lot of replay value.

Where It Falls Short
❌ Pay-to-Win Elements – The game heavily relies on DLCs, many of which offer powerful weapons or benefits that give paying players a significant advantage. This has been a major turn-off for long-time players​
STEAMCOMMUNITY.COM
.

❌ Buggy Experience – Despite numerous updates, PAYDAY 2 still has persistent bugs that can ruin missions. From crashing to weird AI behavior, the game's technical issues are frustrating​
STEAMCOMMUNITY.COM
epetitive Missions** – While the core gameplay is enjoyable, the missions can feel very repetitive after a while. Despite the variety of heists, there’s a lack of meaningful variety that makes completing them over and over feel like a grind.

❌ Unbalanced Progression – Some players feel that the progression system is unbalanced. You can unlock powerful skills too quickly, making the game too easy at times or too difficult at others, depending on how you build your character .

PAYDAY 2,"THIS GAME IS FUN WITH FRIENDS AND THUS I RECOMMEND IT. But I cannot ignore the devs' BRAINDEAD interpretation on 'difficulty'. Inflating enemies' health pools certainly makes the game harder but it turns the game into a resource management simulator. Having to waste half my ammo on a single bulldozer is ridiculous. It is boring, frustrating and it completely kills my immersion. I am still yet to play the hardest difficulties so I am really hoping these issues are (somewhat) rectified but I can only see it being even worse. This game is great for a laugh with your mates for a cheap cost too but I hate how artificial the difficulty is. But anyways let me talk about the things I love.

When I first discovered that this game uses a skill tree and perk system I was skeptical however I actually really like it. There are so many options to choose from and you are given plenty of freedom in your build; by that I mean selecting certain upgrades won't lock you out of others and I find that choice very refreshing because I never have to worry if my build is perfectly optimal as I can just get the other upgrades later. 

The level design is very good, plenty of nooks and crannies to take cover in and the procedural generation makes it more engaging when you are restarting/replaying the same mission. I can't speak from experience of course but the game, in my eyes, perfectly encapsulates how it'd feel to perform a heist.

The gameplay itself is also very fun with the unique enemies and their designs to fit the theme of the mission you're playing and I enjoy all the tasks you must do while fending off the hordes of cops and the like.

All in all, very fun game WITH FRIENDS but the difficulty and balancing takes a lot away from the experience for me",True,Strategy

Dying Light,"If you want some Mirrors Edge in your Dead Island, look no further. On a serious note, this is one of the greatest zombie games ever made, even 10 years later it holds up remarkably. My only regret is not completing the campaign sooner having completed the sequel at release in 2022. 

Here's the breakdown of who should dive into Harran and who might want to look elsewhere if you're still on the fence:

[b]Who should play Dying Light:[/b]
[list]
[*]Parkour enthusiasts: If you love the idea of fluid movement and mastering a challenging traversal system, Dying Light's parkour is a major selling point. It's not just a gimmick, it's core to the gameplay and incredibly satisfying to pull off.[*]Zombie fans with a taste for tension: The day/night cycle is a game-changer. If you enjoy the feeling of dread creeping in as the sun sets and the infected become more aggressive, Dying Light delivers that in spades.
[*]Players who like a mix of action and survival: It's not pure survival horror, and it's not just mindless action. Dying Light finds a good balance between scavenging, crafting, combat, and tense escapes.
[*]Those who enjoy open-world exploration: Harran is a big place with lots to discover. If you like exploring and finding hidden secrets, you'll have plenty to do.
[*]Co-op players: Zombie slaying with friends is always a good time, and Dying Light's co-op mode is exceptional between the campaign, challenges, and more. 
[/list]
[b]Who might want to pass on Dying Light:[/b]
[list]
[*]Players who prefer realistic zombie simulations: If you're looking for a game where zombies are slow and easy to dispatch, Dying Light's fast and aggressive infected might not be your cup of tea.
[*]Those who dislike repetition: Mastering the parkour and surviving the night often requires repeating sections. If you get easily frustrated by this, it could be a turn-off.
[*]Players who prioritize story above all else: While the story is decent, it's not the main focus. If you need a strong narrative to stay engaged, you might find it lacking.
[*]Those who are easily scared: The nighttime sequences can be genuinely terrifying. If you're not a fan of jump scares and intense situations, you might find it a bit too much.
[/list]
I can't recommend this game enough, I would sing its praises at full price ($19.99 these days). It is on sale at the time of writing for $5.99. Skip the cup of coffee and pick this game up.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"Review: Dying Light 1 has been one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. This game offers a unique combination of action, horror, and parkour skills that keeps you entertained and challenged for hours.

Graphics: The city of Harran is beautifully designed with a lot of details, immersing you in a post-apocalyptic world full of dangers and challenges. The lighting and environmental effects are impressive and effectively convey a scary and tense atmosphere.

Gameplay: The parkour system allows you to move freely within the game environment, escaping from or overcoming zombies. The parkour skills make every moment of the game feel thrilling and full of adrenaline.

Melee combat is also very diverse and engaging. You can use a variety of melee and ranged weapons and also craft different traps and equipment to survive. The variety of enemies is vast, and each type of zombie and dangerous creature attacks you with its own strategies.

Storyline: The storyline is captivating and keeps you engaged until the end of the game. The characters are well-developed, each with their own stories and motivations. The main and side missions are very diverse, each with its own challenges and rewards.

Music and Sound Design: The game's music is very appropriate and in sync with the game's atmosphere, enhancing the feeling of fear and tension. The voice acting of the characters and the zombies is also very realistic and professionally done.

Overall, Dying Light 1 is an unforgettable and exceptional experience that I recommend to every fan of survival horror games. This game combines all the necessary elements for an exciting and adrenaline-packed experience and will keep you entertained for hours.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"The best zombie game of all time, parkour system is great. Upgrades are great, combat is weighty. Still a great game to play in 2025, with so much content, especially if you get the DLC. A must play game.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"10 years later and its still a 10/10 for me
the story is decent, the parkour and combat are amazing, the world is awesome, and its all and all impressive and well worth your time.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"amazing game. good graphics for 2015, good game mechanics and phisics but i play on normal and its quite hard its better to play with more people",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"The phrase ""Simply a masterpiece"" is correct and can be used in written English.
It is often used to describe something extraordinary or exceptionally well-done. For example, ""That painting is simply a masterpiece, it's hard to believe anyone could create something so beautiful.""


Ten years ago, Dying Light emerged as a groundbreaking survival-horror experience, and today, it remains a gold standard in the genre. A seamless blend of heart-pounding parkour, visceral combat, and an immersive open-world design, Techland crafted an experience that transcended the typical zombie game formula—delivering a dynamic, adrenaline-fueled nightmare that still holds up against modern titles.

From the moment you set foot in Harran, Dying Light ensnares you with its breathtaking world-building. The city, a decaying urban labyrinth teeming with the undead, feels alive in its own eerie way—daylight offers a fragile sense of security, while nightfall unleashes horrors that make every rooftop sprint a desperate fight for survival. The game's parkour system was revolutionary upon release, making movement not just a necessity but an art form. Every chase, every escape, every leap across the ruined skyline feels fluid and exhilarating, a true testament to Techland’s mastery of game mechanics.

Combat is a brutal, weighty affair, demanding both strategy and reflexes. Whether you're slicing through hordes with a well-crafted machete or smashing skulls with a makeshift sledgehammer, every hit carries a tangible, bone-crunching impact. And then, of course, there's the night—where Dying Light truly separates itself from the pack. The transition from hunter to hunted, the sheer terror of being pursued by Volatiles, makes for some of the most pulse-pounding moments in gaming history.

Beyond its gameplay, Dying Light has aged like fine wine, thanks to Techland’s unwavering commitment to post-launch support. A decade later, the game boasts new content, enhanced mechanics, and a dedicated player base that keeps Harran’s streets alive. This isn’t just a survival horror game; it’s a testament to what happens when developers pour passion into their work.

In an era where many games fade into obscurity, Dying Light remains, simply, a masterpiece.

Hundreds or possibly thousands of places to explore, but travelling at night is dangerous.  If you like a challenge, try some night trips outside, be prepared to either fight or run.

Dying Light,"So I used to play this game on Xbox, and thus have probably sunk a lifetime amount of around 250 hours playing this game. Its basically what you'd get if Dead Island and Mirror's Edge had a baby, and it is probably my favorite zombies game ever, just next to COD Zombies. Roger Craig Smith delivers a really amazing performance in this game, and the story has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, but I think those moments are only as impactful because of Roger. The story is, in hindsight, kind of basic. Jade is pretty unlikable, and Rahim was really the only other character I found myself entirely invested in. Rais is cool, but he's pretty two-dimensional. The GRE and Ministry of Defense are a whole other beast and I love all the story beats with them involved. The gameplay is genuinely unmatched, however, and the parkour NEVER gets old. My sole complaint with the parkour is that you cannot wallrun, which was shown in the trailer for the game. The gameplay is honestly super addicting though. Combat feels awesome, parkour feels awesome, and the progression feels really good. The Dark Machete is probably my favorite weapon in this game :) I would highly recommend to all of you reading this that you play this game. It's worth your time.

Dying Light,"I want to like Dying Light, but so much of it just is mechanically poorly designed and unfun to interact with.

Basically, the game wants to be Mirrors Edge of the Dead. You're in a zombie infested city; run around, explore, find weapons, fight enemies, pretty basic. There are four main skill/ skill trees to focus on: Running, Fighting, Surviving, and LEGEND,

Running you level up by running. At the start you can barely run fifteen feet, so you'll basically need to level up as soon as possible so you can actually explore and not get swarmed by zombies. Zombies are scary, the devs want you to run away instead of fighting - weapons have low damage, low durability, and can only be repaired a small amount of times. So level up fighting to fix that - by fighting with all the terrible fighting skills you have. You can barely kill a zombie with and when you try the game just spawns more behind you? Well yeah, you're not supposed to fight. Don't focus on the fighting. 

At least Survivor skills are interesting - new mechanics, like shields, throwables, camo, HP regen to just outside three hit deaths. At higher levels, you get a grappling hook so you can ignore all the running you did first. Also dont die, because then you'll lose the XP you earned.

Is the story good? Pretty much. Is running around fun? Yeah. Is this game explicitly designed for controllers. Oh god yeah. Designed for Co-Op and Dark Souls style invasions? Yeah, and some of it so badly designed its almost impossible to do solo. Don't worry, you can check the wiki pages and see that it recommends you buy the DLC weapon packs for the strongest version of the weapons to help you.

I want to like Dying Light. I really do, but every time I played I just got frustrated with the clunky controls, badly designed enemies, poor quality of life, and repetitive experience. But hey, at least the running is pretty fun when you get it to max level and can now sprint without stopping every 10 feet.",False,Strategy
Dying Light,"The definition of mediocrity and special enemies not having different icons on the mini map is bullshit. Not to mention fitting viral zombies and humans is exceptionally awful and no matter what weapon I use from a random pipe on the ground to a crafted sledge hammer with saw blades it still takes way too long to kill enemies, or the hit detection for headshots is completely mangled.",False,Strategy
Dying Light,"If you like JRPGS then this game is your thing. Every quest outside of the main story, is kind of a needless grind. Please let me explain. There two different types of weapons melee and range. You will find better melee and ranged weapons along the way. Side quests rarely offer stronger weapons or gear to help the player loadout. In my experience playing the game I happened upon stronger weapons outside of the side quests. Furthermore, the side quests rarely add to the main story or even flesh out the world. Side quest simply exist to help the player grind EXP and grow to a higher LVL. being a higher LVL makes the game more fun.

Dying Light,"TLDR: Gameplay is good but the story is awful.

I was excited by the reviews, but after playing the story mode I give it a 6/10. The gameplay loop is great, the movement and the environment is top notch. But to hinder all gameplay to an awful story mode took all my enthusiasm. All I could think when I got to the end credits after a very anticlimactic QTE end fight was ""Finally it is over"". Probably much more endurable with friends. It would be way better with more survival elements and more freedom on your own character. Still for the price I got it on sale I still recommend it. Would not replay the story though, just the parkour zombie gameplay.",True,Strategy
Dying Light,"Man, where to begin. I first came across this game thanks to a Vanoss video when it was first released a decade ago. I was 15 at the time and had saved up enough to buy the original Xbox One. I was a big BF/COD fan but obviously during that time both series were going through some serious stagnation (Ironic given the current state of both series). So Dying Light was the first game I got for it and I was hooked. The story, pacing atmosphere, weapons, all the different tools, mechanics and everything in between was just *chef's kiss* a masterpiece. The graphics looked incredible on the Xbox One and still hold up today on PC. Co-op with my buddies only magnified the experience and made the game even more replayable no matter how many times I nailed Rais with the knife in the final showdown. Fast forward a year and The Following drops. I wasn't allowed to have a TV, let alone an Xbox in my room at all growing up. My mom was definitely one of those ""video games will rot your brain"" parents but she was understanding enough to let me save up for my own Xbox. The weekend The Following dropped she was out of town for work, while my dad was re doing the floors of the kitchen and living room. So a bunch of furniture and stuff was piled in my room, including the TV we had in the living room. My dad didn't mind me playing video games as long as I wasn't loud. So after helping him tear up the old floor for a couple of hours after school, I hopped on with my buddies and played The Following all night long. IMO The Following was a perfect follow-up. The dune buggies, the countryside setting, new quests and the mystique surrounding the cult was just incredible. This game will always hold a special place in my heart and I always find myself coming back to play the game time and time again. I know a good chunk of the fanbase feels a certain type of way about Dying Light 2. Personally I think Techland tried to catch lightning in a bottle twice and just fell short. However I will always give credit to Techland for being one of the few developers nowadays that actually listens to the fanbase. I really hope The Beast will be as good as the original two games and does a proper service to the Kyle Crane storyline and I think Techland is well aware of the high expectations of the fanbase. I really can't stress enough how much I love this game and can't recommend it enough even a decade after it's release. Hats off to Techland for creating a core piece of my late childhood.",True,Strategy

Dying Light,"'Dying Light' is an open-world Eurojank zombie game that's so chaotically stuffed with content it's often difficult to make priorities and keep track of progress.  There's so much going on here it's possible to sink 15-30 hours completing the story without even experiencing a solid chunk of the side content.  It's all a bit overwhelming at first and the sprawling, infested map does a wonderful job keeping you feeling small and outnumbered.  As you get the hang of the systems and controls, this hostile environment begins to feel quite exciting.  By the time you've made some significant progress, that world that initially felt impossibly hostile now serves to thrill and empower you.  

I didn't work too hard completing most of the side activities, jumping in spontaneously if I happened across one on the map but never making a point to track them down with completionist intent.  This game is a fun diversion but its visual design and thematic presentation fall short of compelling me to spend time with it after the credits have rolled.  I spent most of my time in co-op, playing with a friend, and doubt I would have finished the game otherwise.  The story is serviceable but it's simply train-tracks to keep you moving through the world in an exciting fashion.  It's the emergent encounters occurring between you and your friends—against the zombie horde—that keep things interesting.  

Everything that's good about this game comes at the cost of being overdeveloped, leading to a feeling of bloat that's intimidating to approach and clunky even when you're used to it.  There's a type of person who will absolutely adore all of this random content but for me it just feels messy and uninspired.  While I had fun strengthening my bonds with my friends I doubt I'll ever be playing 'Dying Light' again.  Perhaps I'll pick up the sequel when I can get all of the content for >$20 (as I did for this one).

In the beggining i was thinking it will be a lame game, when i first got chased in the nights my anxiety rose for a moment, the pursuit in the night are kinda a thing for this game. I played multiplayer only for a bit, because i didn't have the experience of it i got nailed without knowing what i was doing. I think it has good elements, i would reccomend it, i am not sure of the activity of the community though, didnt search it a lot. What i didn't like was sometimes the repetetive actions in the story, like going back and forth whole ways instead of just fast travelling? trascedence via other way? Since you unlock a place i think it should be an option to just go faster from one way to other. I would reccommend this game.",True,Strategy

Dying Light,"It’s hard to believe that Dying Light has been around for 10 years now, but its blend of parkour action, eerie survival horror, and a robust RPG leveling system remains as compelling as ever. Developed by the same team behind Dead Island, the game offers a familiar framework with an exciting twist. While its RPG and leveling mechanics echo the style of its predecessor Dead Island, Dying Light takes the tension up a notch.

For me, the most unforgettable element has been the way the game uses sound to build atmosphere. The growls and screams of the infected send shivers down your spine, fueling that adrenaline rush every time you’re on the run. Even after just four hours of play, I found myself hooked, caught in the thrilling cycle of fear and exhilaration—though I’m still at a lower level and often find myself struggling to fend off the horde.

While I haven’t yet experienced the game with friends, the potential for a shared, chaotic adventure is undeniable. If you’re new to Dying Light, I highly recommend connecting your account to unlock extra goodies and enhance your overall experience. In a nutshell, whether you’re revisiting it after years or playing for the first time, Dying Light is a timeless thrill that proves some classics never fade.",True,Strategy

Gameplay: Exceptional parkour and a dynamic day-night cycle make for a thrilling survival experience. Combat is solid, with room for improvement in shooting mechanics.

Graphics/Sound: Impressive visuals with atmospheric sound, enhancing the survival horror feel.

Multiplayer: Adds significant replay value with co-op and Be The Zombie mode.

Dying Light,"💥 Dying Light: The Ultimate Parkour-Fueled Zombie Apocalypse Experience! 💥

Dying Light and its expansions deliver an adrenaline-pumping mix of open-world exploration, brutal melee combat, and heart-racing parkour mechanics that redefine the zombie survival genre. From the sunlit rooftops of Harran to the eerie countryside in The Following, every moment is a test of skill, reflexes, and resourcefulness.

Core Gameplay & Atmosphere
The game thrusts you into a vast, infected city teeming with danger. By day, scavenging and crafting are your best allies as you leap across rooftops, avoiding the undead hordes below. But when night falls, the true terror begins—agile, lethal Volatiles emerge, turning the hunter into the hunted.

Dying Light's fluid movement system makes escaping the infected feel exhilarating, while the brutal combat ensures every encounter is intense. Weapons degrade over time, forcing you to improvise and adapt, whether with a reinforced baseball bat or a shocking katana.

The Following DLC – Expanding the Nightmare
This expansion takes the terror beyond the city, offering a vast countryside to explore—this time with customizable buggies that make mowing down zombies even more satisfying. The cult-like mystery surrounding the new infected keeps you guessing, while the multiple endings add replayability.

Key Highlights:
✅ Parkour-Focused Gameplay: Leap, climb, and vault across rooftops in one of the most fluid movement systems in gaming.
✅ Terrifying Day/Night Cycle: A perfect balance of risk vs. reward—stay out too long, and you’ll regret it.
✅ Brutal Melee Combat: Satisfying, weighty, and strategic weapon-based combat keeps every fight engaging.
✅ Expansive Open World: From urban decay to vast farmlands, exploration is both rewarding and dangerous.
✅ Engaging Co-op: Survive with friends, race to supply drops, or cause chaos together.

Pros:
✔️ Immersive world with dynamic weather and a haunting soundtrack.
✔️ Engaging story with strong side missions and lore.
✔️ Deep skill progression system that rewards different playstyles.
✔️ Tons of content, especially with The Following expansion and community events.

Cons:
❌ Night sequences can feel punishing for casual players.
❌ Some missions become repetitive over time.
❌ Driving mechanics in The Following could be smoother.

🎮 Final Verdict: If you love survival horror, intense action, and freedom of movement, Dying Light is an absolute must-play. Whether you’re scaling a crumbling tower, drop-kicking zombies off a ledge, or racing against time at night, this game delivers an unforgettable, heart-pounding experience.

Barotrauma,"The game can be a mixed experience. Some players might find it boring due to the long campaign, griefing teammates, or having to play solo because of a lack of friends. On the other hand, with a good crew, it can be a blast! Whether it's tackling bandits on abandoned outpost missions, taking down abyssal creatures against all the odds, or just having a great time screaming like a 5-star actor to your deaths together.

The game is well-made, and in my 200 hours of playing, I never had crashes or major performance issues (except in colonies). The sub editor is also very intuitive, allowing for endless customization of submarine systems and decorations.

The modding community in this game is also spot-on, with several engaging mods such as Real Sonar, The nightmarish Neurotrauma (which taught me alot about medicine), environmental mods, and the stupid funny stuff that gives me a laugh every time I tried them.

For me, most of the fun came from building submarines with advanced systems using dozens of logic gates, heavily decorating them to tell a story through the designs and rooms, or modifying built-in subs. I’d guess at least 70% of my playtime was spent in the sub editor, I'm not joking.

Overall, you like building subs? Or managing crews? Go for it. Otherwise you might have a bit of a bad time.",True,Strategy

Barotrauma,"   The game is very immersive, nearly all of my good memories have been about me and my friends struggling to survive in these crushing depths. An the good part is... we enjoyed it to addiction. The game lore may be somewhat underwhelming, but it is still nice addition to overall gameplay, though I like non-obvious choices like adding clown fraction to the game. 
   Modding community is huge and you can transform your campaign till it becomes even more of a horror. Submarine editor is a humongous advantage and it lets you build extraordinary mechanisms in your submarine and I appreciate that all the electricity stuff is not hidden in the actual game so you can modify the submarine mid-game, though it takes skill, which is perfectly fine.
   The game has it flaws and bugs ( starting the game with non-cyrillic keyboard layout selected in linux still ends up with unusible letter keys as on 13.02.2025; and this bug is still present in game's github page), but I recommend this game nontheless.

Barotrauma,"One of the most unique and engrossing games I have ever played. The constant ocean dread, survival chaos and interesting mechanics along with ease of entry make this a fantastic game, however even after all this time and thousands upon thousands of hours I keep coming back and playing/modding/shipbuilding. 

However while I cannot recommend this game enough it does have some severe warts you have to be aware of before you take your first plunge into that midnight sea. 

1. Performance, the game was originally designed to run on a single core and it shows, we joke it runs best on a Pentium 4. I have a fairly beefy rig and due to hyper threading I still have some serious load in time issues. The majority of players run the LUA for Barotrauma extension Clientside along with Evil Factory's Experimental performance fix. The 2024 Winter update did some changes to ruins that have made Performance Fix almost mandatory for Vanilla server playthroughs as there can be extreme FPS drops in the Great Sea region in particular due to multiple effects that occur on those levels alongside the more larger more intensive ruins. 

2. Community, its small, heavily fractured among 3 big factions English, Russian and Chinese. With extremely small Spanish and German communities. Also there is a fair amount of toxicity due to people learning to play the game amongst friends for months that would result in getting banned on most public servers. This leads to a fair amount of friction and there are constantly singular and groups of trolls that roam around trying to find servers to grief leading to very heavy private and whitelist servers.

3. Modding, game has an excellent open ended .xml framework with modded LUA extension and even C# through that. However 60% of servers in public are usually vanilla games which are perfectly fine to play and really help you learn the game. The reason modding accounts for a smaller share is due to the difficulty of balancing a good modpack, learning how to stack mods that require patches and/or LUA/C# as well as public players having a hard time setting up LUA and trying to just force join a server that bugs out constantly. There are a lot of very old mods people also try to run that severely impact the performance of the game and some mods have entire mindsets around how they should function or impact player interactions that differ WILDLY between servers. People will refuse to play the game without X mod but if Y submod of X or if X and Z are used together they will also refuse to play making building a collection challenging to say the least. 

4. Baro burnout, its a big issue for longtime players who just get sick of multiple aspects of the game such as performance issues, lack of new content, dealing with drama from other players or just crisis management. A lot of new players quit very early due to feeling like the game has a high skill wall for the mechanics, culture shock from joining a string of toxic or unwelcoming servers or just repeatedly getting kicked or banned from not understanding what they were doing is wrong and/or becoming toxic due to this. 

That being said if you can tough through some hard times and make it through several sessions of a campaign you will be rewarded with one of the most unique and memorable gaming experiences possible. as you and the crew band together to survive in a hostile alien ocean inside a rickety secondhand submarine locked in the midst of a full on civil war fueled by rampant societal decay from decades of isolation from Earth. As you dive ever deeper and uncovering mysteries of the moons myriad factions and the ruins of an ancient civilization.",True,Strategy

Strong recommend, happy sailing submariners.

As a side note: our top moment so far: We are in a brand new Orca 2, the gunner is checking out his very first railgun. As we set sail, I (capitan) spot some hammerheads on the sonar, i relay that info to him and he shoots them kinda late, when they were basically right under the command room. As i later realised the railgun shell he used was packed with C4 - the explosion severed both my legs, threw me up to the ceiling with such impact that my neck breaks and im dead on the spot.",True,Strategy

Also a great advertisement for clowns in general.",True,Strategy
Barotrauma,"A very chaotic, very fun game to play with friends(I cannot speak for public campaigns as I have never tried it). Blends random events with scripted sequences in a way that makes things familiar but fresh all the time. I have 65 hours on this game at this time, and I haven't played with anything more than cosmetic mods, so the game shall gain even more replay-ability once I start delving into modded content, which is incredibly well supported by the devs. 

I play this game weekly if not more, and its an absolute delight. I thoroughly reccomend this game :)",True,Strategy
Barotrauma,"it is a little hard to get used to at first but after a few missions, you get used to it",True,Strategy
Barotrauma,"I feel like I have played enough to say I recommend this. One thing to note is that I have not beaten this game yet. Mainly because I just enjoy messing around and have not really focused on playing it fully through.

There are two main ways I have played this, Solo with bots and then playing with friends.

Solo:
While not as fun with friends it's not actually that terrible. You will not have any funny voice chat moment or hearing your friend get ripped to shreds but that's the price to pay. The bots for the most part are smart as long as you instruct them correctly. I have had moments where some subs glitch them out a bit (non-modded btw). It can easily be fixed though and I think a recent patch may have fixed it fully (not confirmed on my part yet). You will be doing all the fun stuff solo which can make it more difficult. Bots can follow you outside the sub but they are not the best in combat and can even shoot you more then anything. Keep them in the sub doing the boring stuff as you go Rambo on all the missions.

Squad up with friends:
Not much to say other then this is a lot of fun. Of course it will depend on if your friends are fun but I am sure that won't be a problem. Even when playing seriously, funny moments just happen.

Modding:
Mods are great and some of my favorites are the ones that expand on certain missions like being able to salvage ships. There are different subs you can download, player models, music, enemies and much more. Mess around with them and figure out what's best for you.

I highly recommend this game but if you don't want to take just my word for it go check out some videos on Youtube. People like Criken have recorded many videos and streams on this game showing what it has to offer.",True,Strategy

Barotrauma,"Barotrauma is one of the best games I've ever played, Make sure you have some friends though since that is absolutely vital to the experience.

The art style is great, the combat is great, all the myriad of mechanics this game has to offer are really engaging and fun. The modding community is great, and mods for this game all feel incredibly well made which provides for a seamless experience unlike some other games. The difficulty is entirely variable even within a run, you can play at whatever pace you want which makes it great to experiment.

The only real con is that playing solo isn't fun, especially with the trash ai.

me and my gf love playing this game, i got it when i learned it was made by the same visionaries that made containment breach. we love it, it's a lot of fun, we're still begginers but we're learning. one expedition we find a box inside the sub, we open it at gunpoint and out comes...
THE CUTEST FUCKING THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY GOD DAMN LIFE. IT'S LIKE A MIX BEWTWEEN A TOAD AND A SLUG MAKING PURRING NOISES.
we immediately bonded with it as though it was our own flesh and blood. we spent an hour just playing with it, feeding it and got into a fiery debate about where we should put it so it can stay safe. we come to the consensus that the gunnery room is the safest.
we go along with our expedition until disaster stikes. we're attacked, i go to try and fix a pump and a mudraptor comes out and mauls me to death. the entire ship floods as we're under attack by about 5 crawlers. our pet is still alive, blissfully unaware of the danger around him as he swims around the flooded sub carefree.
then my girlfriend makes a horrible mistake. she turns on the reactor while its flooded and idk what she did, but the whole thing blew up and flooded us with radiation. we struggle to salvage what little remains of the ship when we realise that we dont know where our pet is.
we put everything on standby and desperately look for him, and finally my girlfriend finds him. silent and immobile. she picks him up and brings him to me.
i try everything i can think of to wake him up but it's evident that he died in the explosion.
we load a save and hope that maybe just maybe we'd be blessed with this pet's presence within our ship. but no such thing happens.
the box didnt even spawn.

I can't say if the game is good nor bad. But i was unable to play with my friends. This was mainly due to a bug that affected my keyboard and the game it self.

Barotrauma,"This game used to be really simple fun, but with the addition (among others) of the quality of items makes the game less skill and cooperation-based and more of a rush to get enough levels and experience to craft max level items which basically break the game, some skills as well will make the game a cakewalk. 

Also some things will ruin your campaign right off the bat, like husks (there are new, more annoying versions of them now) that you cannot kill with the pea shooter you're given at the start (also there used to be decent random items spawning in your sub, now it's standardized in the worst way possible as you're given the bare minimum to live thru the first level)

That wouldn't be too bad if you could play the previous versions, but you can't, you can only play the unstable version.

We undock from the underwater outpost to witness our mission objective flash right next to our sub. Easy mode today, we think. Before reaching the objective, however, a hammerhead shark penetrates the submarine hull and flood alarm goes off in a couple of compartments. Sink rate starts to increase. Nothing to worry about, just follow the process and do the needful. The captain trusts his crew and waits patiently, looking at the badly flickering sonar screen for further threats. Knowing that the crew is busy with hull repairs, he decides to stretch outside of his normal duties and starts fixing the worn-out sonar during the downtime. Not being his top expertise, he accidentally shortcuts the submarine’s electric system with a screwdriver, fries the electrical junction boxes and passes out by the zap. Lights go out for a moment and ballast pumps stop functioning. Still nothing to worry about, we have done this before. When the power eventually comes back again and the captain wakes up with a bad concussion, he notices a bright return on the sonar screen. Probably an iceberg, he thinks. Meanwhile the gunner is eyeballing through the periscope and starts to scream in panic, describing a horrifying monster the size of a building gazing at us with its dozen eyes. The monster latches itself to the submarine and pulls us rapidly to the bottom of the sea floor, thousands of feet below our mission objective. A fierce battle of survival starts to lift the crackling submarine back from the ocean floor. And thanks to excellent crew coordination, camaraderie and personal sacrifices we eventually return to the outpost with the head of the monster laying on our deck. A ceremonial celebration commences in the airlock. Captain plays a ballad with his accordion, old trophy from our maiden voyage long time ago. The beers are paid with the company credit card this time.

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"While Monster Hunter World may have better visual and sound design, in terms of gameplay - probably the most important aspect of a game - Rise completely blows World out of the water.

Plus, the monster roster includes Chameleos, who just so happens to be my absolute favorite one.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"It's good.  
World had a better feel, graphics and hunting.
Rise has better combat, quality of life/convenience and is what I feel a step in the right direction.

Now that wild is right around the corner I'm not sure if there is any reason to come back to this, but as a monster hunter game it's good. And if you cleared world, and you're looking for something to do in the meantime it's also good. Or touch grass, idk.",True,Strategy

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Better multiplayer, monster design, and value than Wilds can ever hope to have.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"A real surprise. As someone who played Freedom and Freedom Unite back in the day and didn't play MH since, I expected to bounce off Rise but the game naturally sucked me in. 

The combat is fantastic. Fast and paced well, complex but not requiring rote memorization of combos like character action games, and monsters that balance substance and spectacle equally. Wirebugs essentially make this more of a parry-focused character action game, which many complained about but personally I love and is a reason I will always come back to Rise. Trading DPS for recovery with wirefall keeps the pace of the game. I do agree that the monsters are too slow in comparison to the player, but thankfully Sunbreak fixed that.

Riding Palamutes fixed my biggest problem with old MH. Watching a monster run away, however realistic it was, was always deflating because of how long it took to catch up. Now it's a non-issue.

Characters are likable. Story is good, 
especially in Sunbreak. Rampages suck solo but there are only three mandatory ones. Follower system in Sunbreak should be a mainstay, as should mounts. This is my favorite game to play right up there with Sekiro; the combat is that fulfilling, the study neverending.

Also it's well-optimized unlike Wilds lmao",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"It's been so long since I last played a monster hunter game. I enjoyed 4U and Generations Ultimate, but when world came out, I had a tough time getting into it due to it being so different from the previous two I played. When rise came out on switch, I played it for a good amount. When monster hunter rise was released on steam, I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue playing on switch or start fresh on steam, and it took until just now to finally get back to playing it and catching up on all the updates for rise and of course sunbreak!

While I don't have as much nostalgia for this game as much as I have for 4U, I really enjoyed this game! Especially when I unlocked the sunbreak content! Combat is fast and it didn't take long to get back into the zone! One thing in particular I like is that while we still have lobbies that we can join, it's nice that there is also the option to join other people's quests similar to the sos flares in World. One thing I like about sunbreak is the unlockable followers which makes hunting much easier and is nice to have when farming materials. I kinda wish I was playing this when the content for each update was released, since it would be easier to find players for join requests. Fortunately, even though in sunbreak it was not easy to find people to help, I surprisingly was able to solo monsters that I would have never thought of even trying in older games. 

Overall, it's worth noting at this time that I have not fully finished sunbreak yet (at MR 5), but plan to go back to it once I finish the main story of Wilds and get bored of it lol. All monster hunter games are enjoyable in their own right and offer something unique from each other, which makes them all worth playing!",True,Strategy

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Fixes many of the issues introduced in World. The game is quick to get you into combat, and the mechanics are tight and well balanced. Post-game has an enjoyable loop, and you always have something to progress.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"actually, it's really good
I didn't expect to like it, but here we are

the wirebug mechanic makes the game feel fresh and fun even after finishing world
that and the mount system makes getting around feel really seamless
not having to track monsters is... fine. I preferred it the way it was in world but rise's way of handling it means there's more action with less downtime which is fun in its own way

I highly recommend this game to everyone who's even slightly invested in monster hunter games
as for those who aren't yet, maybe try monster hunter: world first, it's a great experience",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"It's alright. Not as pretty as world, not as immersive, and they remove a lot of elements from monster hunter world such as looking for clues or exploring the map, but to compensate for it, it's the lightest monster hunter game for PC (if you exclude people emulating older monster hunter games). 

[b] The gameplay is more refined [/b] , the game is way faster as well, but this is less of a [i] monster hunter game [/i] and more of a [b] Monster Fighter [/b] game than anything else. And if you hated clutch claw on world, it's not present here.

Playing online is more straight foward too, as there are no cutscenes like world had, and it's less of a hassle to play with your friends.

Overall, its alright, i give it a 6.9/10. [i] Not as good or as immersive as MHWorld, but if you dont mind the visual downgrade due to being a switch port? then you'll have a blast[/i].",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"A delightful time. This is my second Monster Hunter game, after World, and while I love both the quality of life features in Rise have propelled it to my favorite. The multiplayer is fantastic, I'll spend hours goofing around with my friends and then locking in on harder quests. It strikes a great tone, it's goofy and fun and just a blast. There's so much content, I'm 104 hours in and I still haven't finished Master Rank!",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Compared to Wilds this game:
 - Is excellent to look at
- actually stays above 20fps, often staying at 60
- has better mechanics and doesn't hand-hold you for 5+ hours before you even  unlock the real game
- actually has a lovable cast instead of a bunch of morons
- runs on my Deck as well as my PC
- doesn't make me fumble around with a clumsy rip-off of Red Dead Redemption 2 horse controls just to run my mount around.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,Great Game but why is there still no Cross-Plattform Multiplayer?! >:(,True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"in this game where you Hunt Monsters, you can really feel your power levels Rise throughout the game as you eventually become powerful enough to Break the Sun",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Fun game. Definitely a change from worlds, but personally I love the wirebugs and think it gives the combat the extra oommf it needed.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"As a casual fan of the Monster Hunter series (I've played a few, but I'm no pro!), I approached Rise with cautious optimism.  Boy, was I surprised. This game isn't just an upgrade; it's a reinvention.
 
First, the Wirebug. Forget carefully planned attacks; I was zipping around like Spider-Man, launching myself into aerial combos.  The customizable wirebug skills add incredible depth and variety to combat.  It's ridiculously fun and completely changes the flow of battle.
 
Then there's my trusty steed, Whitefang, and my equally trusty palico, Greyhoundz! The Palamute's traversal abilities are a game-changer. Forget those long treks across the map; I'm cruising around, feeling like a hunter-cowboy-ninja hybrid.  Online multiplayer is smooth and seamless, making hunts with friends even more exhilarating.
 
The story is entertaining and engaging, though not groundbreaking.  It provides a solid framework for the action.
 
The Rampage quests offer a unique, albeit repetitive, challenge. While intense, the need to repeat instances occasionally hampered the overall experience for me.  I understand, though, that for some—especially veteran players—this repetition is part of the series' charm.  The rarity of materials and the grind for crafting are what make those final creations feel more meaningful.
 
Kamura Village is a breath of fresh air, a relaxing contrast to the intense hunts.  Young Yomogi's cooking commentary, set to the catchy Dango song, is pure comedic genius.  It's cute, funny, and perfectly complements the game's dynamic soundtrack.  The music swells during fights, perfectly matching the adrenaline rush.
 
This game also plays incredibly well on the Steam Deck—it feels like it was designed for it.
 
World and Rise offer distinctly different experiences. World is the sprawling cinematic masterpiece; Rise is the snappy, acrobatic thrill ride. Both are amazing in their own way.
 
The early game is easier than previous entries, but the difficulty ramps up quickly.  The grind for materials is still there, but the increased mobility makes it far more enjoyable.
 
Final Verdict:  Monster Hunter Rise delivers a thrilling and refreshing take on the series.  The innovative mechanics, charming characters, and addictive gameplay make it a must-play for any action RPG fan.  However, the occasional repetition of quests, particularly in the Rampage, might be a drawback for some players. The rarity of materials, contributing to the sense of accomplishment in crafting, is a key element of the franchise's enduring appeal.  Despite this minor quibble, it's a highly recommended title—a fantastic entry in the series that deserves strong praise.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"A true Monster Hunter experience. I already had this game on the Switch but since Monster Hunter: Wilds was a disappointment I decided to get this game on PC too! Colorful, fantastical, thematic. All of the good qualities of classic monster hunter with nice quality of life improvements. The wirebug adds additional movement mechanics which I particularly enjoy. If I had one complaint about this game, it would have to be the rampages. Even then, the rampages aren't really mandatory except on a few occasions but water under the bridge. If Capcom makes another game like Rise, I would be more than happy to get it! Good work Portable Team!",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Played this because wilds is unplayable on my Steam Deck 😞. Pretty fun game for first time MH player, pretty much wasted all of my after office night every day for this game rn. run very well on Steam Deck.

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"I've always wanted to play a game of the MH franchise as a kid but never could afford it, and finally getting to dig my hands into it has been a blast. This is one of the best games I have ever played and was surprisingly super easy to get into as a beginner. I'm definitely checking out more of these titles if I get a chance. Enjoyed and loved every second, minute, hour.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Decent fun classic Monster Hunter despite the addition of the rapid movement tech and wirebug abilities. The siege game mode is required less than five times and is an interesting take on the formula, if a bit antithetical to the normal game play.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Real fun combat, and with the 14 different weapon types, as well as almost entirely customizable movesets for all of them, there will surely be something for everyone. While it may not be the most ""authentic"" Monster Hunter experience in the sense that it's a lot less methodical and tactical and instead places more of a focus on the flashiness of the combat, said combat is more than flashy and enjoyable enough to pull its weight as the focus. And even if that methodical nature is less present, it's not gone by any means.

Some might argue that Rise strays too far away from the series' core design philosophy, and while it definitely had its fair share of experimental features, I'd say that it's more than worth it to be open minded and give it a shot.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"MHR is another good MH game. It's different to World in many ways, but overall has great gameplay.",True,Strategy

I don't think many people care about steam link, but if you're away and want to play a pc game, this is it. Fights are slow enough that the delay wont bother you that much, and besides that it's a great game by itself anyway.

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"I got convinced to get it when it went for 10 bucks, and ive not regretted it, it was a kind of afterthought, bcs i was getting other indie games as well, but i still havent played them since ive installed this. 

anyyyway, let me sketch u a pic where i came from in the monsterhunter context, probably about 400 hours in previous installments. but eh.. 

I came from the PS2 / PSP era of MH and i really enjoy this installment in the franchise, my gf and i spend lots of time enjoying the rich world the creators have made and the monsters all have such great personalities.

For some of the monsters it was really a coming home to old friends vibe, the tigrex for example, love that guy, big moves, some new ones but still very nostalgic.

Thanks capcom, wish there was Switch coop with PC bcs then id have a steamdeck and my gf could use her switch and we could play together more easily, right now the laptop setup works, but i wonder how we are going to be able to play wilds in the future.. well see how well figure that out by then. 

I cant wait to see what the end game holds and i hope this review inspires new players to this game, also gotta say, it really runs super smooth on my old ass laptop, so yeah, dont worry, i think this game has been optimised pretty well, so it might even run on your old 1050 gtx thingababob.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Feel however you want about this series being streamlined, but I still find this to be a very fun game.
The unique mechanics with the wirebugs are interesting and add a new aspect to fighting those awesome creatures. 

The movement system in this game is also fun as well. Running on walls, jumping and using the wirebug to swing from one height to another. Useful for more than just moving around the map if you know what you're doing. I'd say buy it and give it a try.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Definitely a good game. This game gives you a freedom to your build and taking any quests. A very good exploring experiences for Monster Hunter veterans, but a very confusing choices for beginner. For beginner, maybe you should explore the game together with your friends. If you are a solo player and beginner, I recommend you to watch the progressive build over time and monster weakness guides on youtube to help you hunt easier.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"This game is pretty good, I think. Easily the most approachable Monster Hunter has ever been. It's a strong place to start. It also released unfinished. I bought this game on the Switch on release and beat it in forty hours, which are rookie numbers for this series. It provided, at the time, nothing worth grinding in the endgame. 

I'll never forgive it for that, but this version of the game is much better, especially with the Sunbreak expansion, which is really great.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"monster hunter is so good. i'm so happy so many people are enjoying the series after world, even though rise is not as good as world, it still is a great game ported from switch, definitely worth a buy for fans of monster hunter that want more monster hunting.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Not as good as mhw, and feels a little gimmicky with the wirebug and the way that wyvern riding works since its like a little minigame but overall pretty fun. Kinda hate the rampage quests tho, but theyre short",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Good mh game, world is better but this is also fun in it's own unique way",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,If you liked the earlier versions of MH you'll like this!  It takes a little to get used to a couple of the new mechanics but it's still fun.  If you're coming from world you'll probably not like it much and that's ok cuz Wilds comes out in a few days.,True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Rise/Sunbreak is as equally worth it as World/Iceborne is. The great stuff about Monster Hunter games is that while you retain your core skills between games, each and every upcoming one has something different about it, a twist that makes it feel fresh. The graphics, while may not be comparable much between the two, are not bad in any way and the monster designs are great. Also, Malzeno is the best flagship in recent years. The combat is faster and you have tons of options to optimise a playstyle that suits you best. I greatly recommend it!",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"A great entry into an established series. The experience is a bit simplified when compared to World, but the core of the Monster Hunter experience remains.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"A wonderful addition to the series featuring a much more dynamic and varied gameplay. Wirebugs and wirebug moves add a whole bunch of depth I did not know I wanted till I got into the game. The varied monster designs and crafted gems are also cool additions. I love the Canyne's movement and the varied support moves the pets come was interesting though I wish you didnt have to choose between Palaco and Canyne since I think the mounting is mandatory especially for bigger maps.

Overall a very nice game, sunbreak is lowkey mandatory if you want to fully enjoy it, I recommend both!",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"More arcadey than Monster Hunter World but still a very fun game. A port from Nintendo Switch so keep your expectations for graphics a little lower but that does not mean it looks terrible, just a different art style than what came before. Would highly recommend if you want more Monster Hunter after World.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"As you can see from the amount of hours i'vs spent on the game. Shits good. I haven't played the Monster Hunter World version but this is one of the best games i've ever played. I know you've seen the ""best game i ever played"" phrase a lot but i do indeed love this game very much. The repeatability, the action, the sense of adventure. A perfect packet of everything. It's like the favourite food you eat all the time and rarely get bored.

However the story/campaign is somewhat mediocre and i'm not talking about the fights in the campaign but the story in itself. I did enjoy the battles a lot. 

I've seen my friends struggle to land hits, get smacked away like flies, crushed, eaten and sat on. It was cinema. Same goes for me. The more you struggle you get better and hunting becomes even more competent and fun. My only dislike and even that should be taken very lightly is the story. 

Would definitely recommend group of friends and solo players too. 

I cant wait to get Monster Hunter Wilds too.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"I am a Monster Hunter fan and have been since the PS2 original release of the series. I fell in love and I have a bias that leans into the nostalgia and appreciation of the series. That said while I ultimately recommend the game here are the main issues I have: 

Cons:

- Too Stereotyped: Japanese. This feels like a 1990s anime in the way it heavily overplays tropes and joke culture of Japanese history. I am not a huge fan of the shogunate times of Japan in general but this over stereotyped joke is a little too much for me. It feels incredibly out of place, in my opinion, every time it rears its head in this series. 

- Too Easy. I had this same problem with MH: World. A big part of what I liked about Monster Hunter in general was the intense souls-like feel of the combat. Monster Hunter has never been a constant intensity of extremely punishing difficulty but the wyvern and dragon fights have at least felt difficult and you could feel that there's a reason that not everyone can cut it as a Hunter. In World the difficulty was barely existent for me and this game is no different. The Difficulty is very slightly raised once the game picks up in the Gathering Hub. The village quests are obscenely easy. 

- Bad Food System. So the food in this game is Dango. You choose three types of food with varying effects and it's not far off from the typical system but it just feels clunky and less useful than the traditional chef setup. I would actually like to see future games with two, three, or four types of restaurants featuring different style of bonuses, cutscenes for cooking, and effect offerings. That way you can start to feel more immersed and really feel connected to the world. That said, the Dango system is just not very good in my opinion. Pin that with a sickly sweet and cutesy cutscene that never seems to grow or change and I am just not a fan. 

- Reduction in Town Offerings. The town just feels small to me and your room barely matters. The farm isn't a farm anymore and while you at least get some degree of visuals comparred to world it's not a ""Trade System"" and I just am not really feeling it. If anything it would have been nice to see some expansion to the farm and a more interesting and intricate system. You have to hire buddies (cats and dogs) to do your farming and group sortees to gather items in this one and it was actually kind of cool to see the beginnings of expansion, but instead of offering a separate set of skills to work through and raise in your new friends it's bare bones and simple. The idea was bursting at the seems with potential and then someone apparently stapled those seems back together. I was very disappointed with that. This reflects more or less how I feel about the game. It could have made advances but played it relatively safe and sunk back into the ruts of the predecessors and fell kind of short for me, even though it's still a decent game. 

- Wirebugs. Anyone whose played world is familiar with the claw system. Not something I cared for personally but it grew on me over time and it at least wasn't an annoying mechanic. In Rise they decided to play silly ninja games with wirebugs which are significantly less useful and more annoying to use when you do use them. This was a major step backwards in my eyes. They are clunky and pretty lackluster. By far my least favorite aspect of Rise. 

- Less to Do. So Monster Hunter seems to have been slowly adapting to the American market, which is to say, lazy gaming. To some points that's fantastic because I will die on this hill: Tedium is NOT content. So it's been nice to see some of the tedious aspects reduced. The problem is they are taking away the alternative challenges of being a Monster Hunter. The lesser monsters are barely worth your notice, they die by accident even as a new hunter. There's no sort of tracking, large monsters are just auto tracked on your map from entry, there's a little to find but no real research or ecological aspects. No scout flies, no paintballs, just a map that's clouded over until you've discovered the whole thing (the one thing I would expect the guild to have done automatically). There doesn't seem to be a way to turn on mining node, bugs, etc... tracking on the minimap so you just run around and pick up things with less searching, just one quick search and you get everything (which feels like I am getting less out of my gathering skills). There's no tiny creatures or pets to pick up, there's no little groups of palicos to meet, there's just... Not a lot. The grind of go in, kill a wyvern or 3, and go home has been refined to an almost boring degree. 

- Mediocre Level Design. Not a lot to say here, the levels just feels bland to me. There's 'off map' locations outside of zones to explore but they all fall short. The cool stuff like a giant pyramid, only 2 small areas to explore. Like a lot in this game, it just isn't that great. Decent, but nothing special. 

- No Large Wyvern Chaos. I know some will cheer for this but if you manage to get 2 large monsters in a zone together they will instantly try to initiate a territorial dispute and hit one another which you then get to freely ride (which is fun but really loses a lot of the skill gain and effort you had to put in so it's less rewarding) and use to attack each other for a few seconds. Then one of them runs off and unless you are startlingly lucky, any time they end up in the same zone again one of them will run off instantly. There's no skill involved, no getting to beat on 2 monsters at once, no threat of 2 or 3 wyverns in one area. It's just like all my other complaints, ok, but lackluster and boring. 

That's the big stuff. The game just... Fails to impress. It's still a monster hunter game, some things are really cool and the new monsters are awesome, it's cool to see some old ones. Ultimately though the game is mediocre. 

I got the game on sale, with Sunbreak, for about $15. That seems VERY on point. Had I paid $40 for this game I'd have felt cheated. If you like Monster Hunter, this is a solid edition. If you're new to the series, the village quests are a fantastic introduction to the game at an easy level. The Gathering hub introduces average difficulty (Low Rank) quests, and then hard (High Rank) quests. The game is a solid addition to the world and series but just isn't anything new or great. Nothing in this stands out but the weird tower defense portion which feels INCREDIBLY out of place. 

Get the game on sale and you'll have a great time sink with a mildly rewarding experience. You will not be blown away (unless this is your first monster hunter game, then maybe you will, at least a little).

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Rise is a strange game to review because a lot of my thoughts on it are intertwined with its expansion, Sunbreak. Just looking at what it takes to reach the final boss at launch, the game is pretty definitively the easiest monster hunter, and that combined with focusing less on ecology than World did turned a lot of people away. At the same time, it also brings back a lot of the old-school MH charm that many, myself included, thought was harder to find in World, and that combined with just how good it feels to control led to me putting in over 100 hours long before Sunbreak came out on the switch version. In addition, near the end of the base game's update cycle Capcom started adding advanced quests, and these are genuinely pretty tough if you're not steamrolling them with Sunbreak gear, so if you only get Rise you're not completely out of luck there. All in all, I do recommend Rise on its own, with the caveat that getting Sunbreak as well is almost mandatory, since its everything Rise does well but turned up to 11, and with some of its more glaring issues completely fixed.",True,Strategy

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"While it's perfectly fine to journey alone, it’s more enjoyable with company.

Monster Hunter Rise stands out as the most colorful and vibrant installment in the Monster Hunter series. But don’t let its beauty fool you—the monsters are just as strong and menacing as ever.

The game offers a variety of playstyles: you can adventure solo, team up with others online, or rely on NPCs for support. The village quests serve as a great introduction to the game’s mechanics and lay the groundwork for the more challenging hunts ahead. In these early stages, you’ll face powerful monsters, but their strength is scaled down for solo players.

However, the difficulty ramps up significantly once you unlock High Rank (HR) missions, and even more so with Master Rank (MR), especially if you’re playing the Sunbreak expansion. The seemingly easy village quests can be deceiving—when you enter HR and MR, the stakes are much higher.

After getting knocked down repeatedly in these tougher missions, I realized that to succeed, I needed to team up with others. I learned to trust the more experienced hunters I met, and by observing their strategies, I grew into a better hunter myself. I hope you also enjoy MHR as much as I do.",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Played MH on console for a while, enjoying it on PC as well.
For new comers its a 3rd person boss fight game, like the name suggests, hunting monsters, which from start to finish are increasingly difficult, if you played Elden Ring this is like that but with combo moves and much faster more fluid movement. Its a hub based world game, semi open world with bigger and bigger maps that host increasignly difficult bosses.
There are lots of weapons to choose from for each style so its best to tinker with each of them and check a tutorial for special moves, tricks and combos since the game is not really helping in that dep... Each weapon has a playstyle, you are more static and slower with a huge weapon like a Greatsword , while you can dart around with dual blades or insect glaive, or even go ranged with different xbows and bows, rifles.
Its a Capcom game so fight coregraphy is peak, hits connect satisfyingly and once you get the hang of it its very thrilling, sound effects are nice and combat animations are clean as expected.
There is a craft sistem and separate quest givers so pay attention to the first part of the game as it will explain you once and its no fun running around the village talking to all npcs randomly.
New players in my opinion should start with Rise + Sunbreak and then move on to the big momma World and Iceborne, or even Wilds or even both, plenty of content.
MH Rise will set the basics and prepare you easily for your monster hunting adventures of which are plenty and some of them very nasty if you suck at remembering attacks, but once you get the hang of the combat and find your weapon, become one with it as they say, the game is a treat that will last for years, also on PC you can mod it easily, and maybe find your favorite anime hero to play as.
Dont worry , you wont miss any plots , stories or lore, its not relevant and its not a story rich game, but a high quality combat game, expecting nothing less from the creators of my all time favorite game Devil May Cry. 
So you can start Rise without missing any crucial lore, go ahead and start hunting, and if you suck at first, dont worry , we all did ... just dodge roll , face the right direction and try again, the reward is quite a thrill.",True,Strategy

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Long time MH fan.

MH Rise is back to the classic formula with a nice little gimmick of the wire bug. Game was originally released on switch which is when I first played it. My humble opinion is the predecessor (MH World) was a better game. The worst part about MHW Was the weapons, looked like you just glued monster parts to a weapon or armor. Rise upgraded in that way.

Rise was a shorter MH game which is okay because it is more a grind for weapons game. Just have to know what you're getting in to.

With MH Wilds soon to come out, it may be a great time to dive back in it and get the basics back. I would recommend playing if you already own it for PC or Switch but don't bother spending money with a new game coming out so soon. DLC is great too but falls in the same boat.

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"It's alright. Played it both on Switch and PC.
Rise plays more like God Eater 3 than Monster Hunter to me. 

It's not a bad game per say. Just not what I'm looking for in the series when it comes to game play normally. I'm still willing to recommend for those who want a faster paced game than normal Monster Hunter games. I just found some changes to the controls in Rise a bit odd or clunky. (But that could just be me).

I did like some of the ideas presented, like swapping out skills or basic moves to create a new play style. And controlling mounted monster was cool in concept, but I think was a bit lacking in execution. Namely that when you ride a monster your teammates might as well not do anything due to the damage reduction which sort of ruins the pacing of the game despite the fact it wants to be fast. Dogs were cool though, I'd like those back someday perhaps.

(Personal Note: I did like the fact they brought back Espinas, please add him into more games).",True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,If the multiplayer worked like in World and they scrapped rampage this would easily be the best Monster Hunter game,True,Strategy
MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Is it a crime to be too easy?

That's probably the most important question for fans of the Monster Hunter franchise to ask themselves. As a relative newcomer to the MH franchise myself, I felt the action and pacing of MH:R better than MH:W before it. The wirebugs add a great deal of speed do just about everything the player can do, and the devs added in a great deal of skills to bolster this fact.

And, with that said, in comes the 'crime'.

The wirebugs give the player a great deal more mobility than pretty much any Monster Hunter game before, since they can pull you far out of reach of the monsters often faster than an actual dodge, significantly reducing the skill curve needed to avoid monster attacks and setup the player for their own offense. And, the offensive skills for many of the weapon classes are, admittedly, very OP. My favorite weapon is the longsword, which has several forms of counter that can stop even the deadliest one-shot attacks from the highest rank monsters completely, negating all damage if you get the timing right. And, the timing for it is QUITE forgiving.

In fact, if you do make heavy use of the wirebug skills against monsters, it reliably (and annoyingly) triggers the snare effect which allows the player to mount the monster and use it as a battering ram or 'monster suit', in effect, to fight other monsters for a brief period of time. It's an extraordinarily easy way to do quite a bit of damage to the monster you're targeting, especially on multi-monster hunts where you can do significant damage to all involved monsters if you use it correctly. And, at the end of the mounted battle, you get a pretty-much guaranteed knock-down on the monster you're riding, as well as easy-mode knockdowns on the other monsters that might be involved. 

However, as you do get better and better at the game, this 'boon' becomes an annoyance more than anything. Not only is it too easy to trigger, but takes a lot of time. It is clunky and mechanical, firmly reminding the player that they are, in fact, playing a video game by shattering the immersion, since it's the same robotic NPC animation every single time. If you don't want to mount the monster and instead keep clobbering it with your string of attacks that you've curated using your favorite weapon instead of the same 3 moves over and over, then you either have to wait for the snare effect to wear off, or hope someone else mounts the monster (one great use for the companion missions that were implemented after Sunbreak).

It is not optional once the snare effect is in place. If you attack the monster during its vulnerable period, you automatically mount it and are stuck ramming it into a wall, clobbering another monster if one is nearby, or waiting until the clock runs out to be ejected from the monster, which is the longest.

This is but one of many ways that the wirebugs break the well-balanced dynamics of Monster Hunter and make it too easy in a lot of ways. Additionally, as mentioned, the snare effect actually breaks immersion as you get better at the game, since it is extremely repetitive and grows stale quickly.

As a whole, though, I love the wirebugs. They're great for travel, I have fun with their attacks, but I won't deny that they make the game significantly easier than a standard Monster Hunter entry.

Replayability definitely comes from the enemies you've yet to beat, and because even Rajang is fairly easy to beat with the power of wirebugs (though, I still hate fighting him), it's easy to clear Monster Hunter Rise (and Sunbreak), and be left simply grinding monsters that you might occasionally lose to, but have otherwise long ago been conquered.

Is it a crime to be too easy? No. It's plenty easy to have a great deal of fun with Monster Hunter Rise and Sunbreak.

But, you might find yourself done and bored once you've beaten the game, leaving you going back to Monster Hunter World or even the harder earlier installments, where the player's skill is much more crucial.

There is plenty of fun to be had with Monster Hunter Rise, but it is, to my knowledge, among the easiest of the Monster Hunter games.",True,Strategy

MONSTER HUNTER RISE,"Review:

Overall, the game is extremely fun because of the newly added wirebug system that was not in the previous games. The added mobility and agility you get with the system is excellent, which speeds up the game's combat and overall hunts immensely. Unlike 4 Ultimate, World, etc., Rise is much easier, and the overall combat is excellent for beginners with older hardware (because this game isn't really that demanding and can run on the Nintendo Switch, which already speaks for itself). 

The game is far more like an arcade, where monsters will automatically move to a designated location after a specific period, and the level of detail in the environment/ecosystem is far less intricate than in World. Overall, if you enjoy a combat game where you only care about hunting monsters, this game is perfect for you. However, if you are a veteran who has played games like 4 Ultimate or World, you should adjust your expectations for this game. 

In conclusion, the game is fun, notably in the combat and quality of life aspects. However, compared to World, the level of detail implemented into the world-building (compared to other MH games) is very lacking. I will give this game a 4.5 out of 5 because the combat stood out, and I enjoyed the overall aesthetic of the village and the art style.",True,Strategy

- it's not a grindy game anymore, *sadly* (at least not from lvl 1-200)
- amazing map BGM's
- a lot of friendly people still and so on

Cons:
- p2w
- bugs, bugs and yes, more bugs! ""yay!""
- gets a bit grindy past 200 and gets a lot grindy past 200 if you didn't pay a lot of real money into it
- the company NEXON America, doesn't care about their customers/players

I could go on forever with the cons and some more pros, but I'll stop here. If you're a new player, I suggest you try this game, but it won't feel ""magical"" anymore.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in the state it is right now.

MapleStory,"I want to start off by saying if you do decide to download and play this game, I would strongly advise just downloading the Nexon launcher and downloading it from there. The steam version of this game seems to have a lot of issues regarding starting the game, on most occasions I have to start my game up about 5 or so times before it finally decides it either doesn't want to crash or it actually wants to connect me to the servers.

Aside from that this game is quite enjoyable. Early game progression is rather fast and you level up relatively quickly, but for me once you start reaching into the 80s it gets a bit tedious. The game can be excessively grindy and it feels like most of your time slaughtering the same enemy 200 times is wasted when you're only given a couple thousand exp. 

Even though the game can be overly grindy it makes up for it with its constant events. A lot of the events in Maplestory stem from special item drops that can be opened to give some sort of special currency, consumables, or trait boosting items. This adds a little extra value from grinding and you're usually able to buy pretty cool cosmetic items or chairs with the special currency.

I'd also like to add that this game is a lot more fun with people you can talk to or a group of in-game friends. The boss party match making isn't very good and more often than not if you are able to be thrown into a party its with one other person and they leave it just to solo the boss anyway.

Party dungeons or themed quests don't have a matchmaking system and as of right now I have a hard time finding anyone willing to party up on my lower level characters.

For starters, they delete your characters after a time. I think this is the third time I have re-downloaded the game, played a bit, and come back to find everything gone.

It has serious scaling and lag issues. We have much better computers these days but still, Maplestory continues to run shittily and at a low resolution. The soundtracks are too repetitive. 

It has some serious frustrating issues with gameplay, like having to use the mouse to interact with NPCs when everything else is strictly keyboard controls. Monsters spawn right on top of you and without delay, picking up items is irritating, and the controls feel laggy. Going from town to monster-fighting areas is near infuriating. The number of keyboard bindings is dizzying for a game that feels like simple hack-n-slash.

Aside from that this game is quite enjoyable. Early game progression is rather fast and you level up relatively quickly, but for me once you start reaching into the 80s it gets a bit tedious. The game can be excessively grindy and it feels like most of your time slaughtering the same enemy 200 times is wasted when you're only given a couple thousand exp. 

Even though the game can be overly grindy it makes up for it with its constant events. A lot of the events in Maplestory stem from special item drops that can be opened to give some sort of special currency, consumables, or trait boosting items. This adds a little extra value from grinding and you're usually able to buy pretty cool cosmetic items or chairs with the special currency.

I'd also like to add that this game is a lot more fun with people you can talk to or a group of in-game friends. The boss party match making isn't very good and more often than not if you are able to be thrown into a party its with one other person and they leave it just to solo the boss anyway.

Party dungeons or themed quests don't have a matchmaking system and as of right now I have a hard time finding anyone willing to party up on my lower level characters.

Maplestory has been around forever, bless its heart, but I just can't recommend this game. I could barely recommend it when it came out, and only because there wasn't much to choose from. For starters, they delete your characters after a time. I think this is the third time I have re-downloaded the game, played a bit, and come back to find everything gone.

It has serious scaling and lag issues. We have much better computers these days but still, Maplestory continues to run shittily and at a low resolution. The soundtracks are too repetitive. 

It has some serious frustrating issues with gameplay, like having to use the mouse to interact with NPCs when everything else is strictly keyboard controls. Monsters spawn right on top of you and without delay, picking up items is irritating, and the controls feel laggy. Going from town to monster-fighting areas is near infuriating. The number of keyboard bindings is dizzying for a game that feels like simple hack-n-slash.

MapleStory,"I have played this game back in 2006 and I had a blast, everything was new to me, the settings, the people running around and killing snails on maple island then slimes and mushrooms in henesys hunting ground. Took many years of breaks in between, back and forth, but when they revamped the game and released big bang is when they started to lose the vast majority of players (slowly).
I know that change is needed for games to progress, but so many changes killed the game.

Pros:
- if you're a fan of mario style games or platformers and like to see big numbers when you hit monster, then try out this game
- it's not a grindy game anymore, *sadly* (at least not from lvl 1-200)
- amazing map BGM's
- a lot of friendly people still and so on

Cons:
- p2w
- bugs, bugs and yes, more bugs! ""yay!""
- gets a bit grindy past 200 and gets a lot grindy past 200 if you didn't pay a lot of real money into it
- the company NEXON America, doesn't care about their customers/players

I could go on forever with the cons and some more pros, but I'll stop here. If you're a new player, I suggest you try this game, but it won't feel ""magical"" anymore.

Maplestory has been around forever, bless its heart, but I just can't recommend this game. I could barely recommend it when it came out, and only because there wasn't much to choose from. For starters, they delete your characters after a time. I think this is the third time I have re-downloaded the game, played a bit, and come back to find everything gone.

It has serious scaling and lag issues. We have much better computers these days but still, Maplestory continues to run shittily and at a low resolution. The soundtracks are too repetitive. 

It has some serious frustrating issues with gameplay, like having to use the mouse to interact with NPCs when everything else is strictly keyboard controls. Monsters spawn right on top of you and without delay, picking up items is irritating, and the controls feel laggy. Going from town to monster-fighting areas is near infuriating. The number of keyboard bindings is dizzying for a game that feels like simple hack-n-slash.

I visit from time to time and always find the same things: Nexon continues to pour development into new classes, new items, new premium things, but zero into the core product, the lag, the intuitiveness.",False,Strategy
MapleStory,"Looks bad at first but when you get in and play it really is an amazing game. Complicated yet simplistic. Immersive gameplay which you can sit down and just play for hours. Relaxing and suprisingly fun to play.

MapleStory,What's this? I was just munching some pasture grass when someone came up to me and gave me a laptop with this game running on it,True,Strategy
MapleStory,"I really do enjoy this game, and I use to no life it on a different account and a different computer entirely, but now that I have this one and I haven't played for so long I can't play the game at all because the Nexon version crashes my pc and the steam version needs you to reenter your pic/pin to play but I can't reset it and everything else simply doesn't work. It's a shame it's such a fun game and I can't play it anymore.",True,Strategy
